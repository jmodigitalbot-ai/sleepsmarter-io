## 1. Medium Syndication Strategy

### Best Practices for Medium Syndication

#### SEO & Canonical URLs
- **ALWAYS use canonical URLs**: When publishing on Medium, you MUST include a canonical link pointing back to the original article on SleepSmarter.io
- **Why this matters**: 
  - Prevents duplicate content penalties from Google
  - Tells search engines which version is the "original" source
  - Preserves SEO value for your main website
  - Medium supports `rel="canonical"` tags, unlike many other platforms

2. **Use Medium's formatting tools**: 
   - Subheadings (H2, H3) for scannability
   - Pull quotes for emphasis
   - Medium's native image formatting
3. **Add a featured image**: Medium articles with images get 94% more views
4. **Keep paragraphs short**: 2-3 sentences max for better readability
5. **Use bullet points and numbered lists**: Medium readers love scannable content

Medium allows up to 5 tags per post. Use these high-performing sleep-related tags:

**Primary Tags (choose 2-3):**
