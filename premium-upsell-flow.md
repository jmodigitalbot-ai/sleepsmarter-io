# Premium Program Upsell Flow: Masterclass → Premium ($67 → $197)

## Overview
Strategic upsell pathway for converting Masterclass purchasers into Premium Program participants. Focuses on implementation tools vs. information, automated systems vs. self-guidance, and tangible resources vs. digital-only content.

## Target Audience
- Recent Masterclass purchasers (within 30 days)
- Engaged Masterclass users (completed 50%+ content)
- Masterclass users asking implementation questions
- Masterclass users demonstrating knowledge but needing tools

## Upsell Triggers & Timing

### 1. Implementation Gap Trigger
**When:** After Module 2 completion (when "how to implement" questions arise)
**Why:** User understands principles but needs tools for implementation
**Message:** "Now that you understand the science, let's get the tools to implement it..."

### 2. Engagement-Based Trigger  
**When:** User demonstrates knowledge retention (quiz completion, notes)
**Why:** Shows learning readiness → now needs implementation readiness
**Message:** "Your understanding is solid. Ready to turn that knowledge into action with our implementation tools?"

### 3. Time-Based Trigger
**When:** 10 days post-purchase
**Why:** Post-consumption period when implementation attempts begin
**Message:** "You've had time with the Masterclass. Many students find this is when they need implementation tools to bridge the knowing-doing gap..."

### 4. Need-Based Trigger
**When:** User asks "How do I actually do this?" or similar
**Why:** Direct request for implementation support
**Message:** "That's exactly why we created the Premium implementation tools. Let me show you how they work..."
