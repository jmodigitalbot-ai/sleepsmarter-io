## 4. Week 1 Content Calendar (Ready-to-Post)

### Monday — Sleep Science Motivation

**9:00 AM:**
Good morning! Did you know your brain cleans itself while you sleep?

The glymphatic system becomes 10x more active during deep sleep, flushing out toxins that accumulate during the day.

Sleep isn't just rest — it's maintenance.

**12:00 PM:**
Quick poll: What's your biggest sleep struggle?

A) Falling asleep
B) Staying asleep
C) Waking up tired
D) All of the above

Reply with A, B, C, or D 👇

**3:00 PM:**
Myth: "You need exactly 8 hours"

Truth: Sleep needs vary by individual (7-9 hours for most adults).

Focus on sleep QUALITY over quantity:
• Consistent bedtime
• Dark, cool room
• Limited screen time before bed

Quality sleep > Perfect duration.

**7:00 PM:**
Tonight's wind-down challenge: No screens 60 minutes before bed.

Instead, try:
• Reading a physical book
• Gentle stretching
• Journaling
• Listening to calming music

Your circadian rhythm will thank you.

### Tuesday — Practical Sleep Hacks

**9:00 AM:**
The 10-3-2-1-0 method for better sleep:

10 hours before bed: No more caffeine
3 hours before: No more food/alcohol
2 hours before: Stop working
1 hour before: No screens
0: The number of times you hit snooze

Try it tonight.

**12:00 PM:**
Hot sleepers, listen up:

Cool your pillow before bed:
1. Put pillowcase in freezer for 15 min
2. Use cooling gel pillow insert
3. Flip pillow to cool side

Bonus: Silk pillowcases stay cooler than cotton.

**3:00 PM:**
If you wake up at 3am, don't check the clock.

Clock-watching increases sleep anxiety. Instead:
• Keep room pitch black
• Practice 4-7-8 breathing
• Focus on rest, not sleep

Sometimes rest is enough.

**7:00 PM:**
Tonight's tip: Try "legs up the wall" pose for 5-10 minutes before bed.

Benefits:
• Calms nervous system
• Reduces swelling in legs
• Promotes relaxation

No yoga experience needed — just lie on floor with legs vertical against wall.

### Wednesday — Thread Day

**9:00 AM (Thread):**
🧵 The Science of Napping: A Complete Guide

Not all naps are created equal. Here's how to nap smarter:

1/ Power Nap (10-20 min)
• Best for alertness boost
• Avoids sleep inertia
• Ideal time: 1-3pm
Perfect for afternoon slump without grogginess.

2/ Recovery Nap (60-90 min)
• Includes full sleep cycle
• Helps with sleep debt
• Can disrupt nighttime sleep if too late
Use sparingly — great for shift workers catching up.

3/ Proactive Nap (Before night shift)
• Take 2-3 hours before shift
• Helps prepare for overnight work
• Reduces fatigue-related errors
Essential for healthcare workers, first responders.

4/ Nap rules to remember:
• Keep it before 3pm
• Set an alarm
• Create nap-friendly environment
• Don't replace nighttime sleep
Napping is a skill — practice makes perfect!

**3:00 PM:**
Quick nap hack: Drink coffee RIGHT BEFORE your 20-minute nap.

The caffeine takes ~20 min to kick in, so you wake up refreshed + caffeinated.

It's called a "caffeine nap" — studied by NASA for pilots.

### Friday — Weekend Prep & Product Focus

**9:00 AM:**
Weekend sleep tip: Don't sleep in more than 1 hour past your weekday wake time.

Large schedule shifts cause "social jet lag" — making Monday mornings brutal.

Instead: Go to bed slightly later, wake at similar time, take afternoon nap if needed.

**12:00 PM:**
Sleep trackers worth considering:

For beginners: Oura Ring or Fitbit
For data nerds: Whoop or Apple Watch
Budget option: Free app + manual logging

Remember: Tracking should reduce anxiety, not increase it.

**3:00 PM:**
If you struggle with night sweats, consider moisture-wicking sheets.

Bamboo or Tencel sheets:
• Naturally temperature regulating
• Wick moisture away
• Softer than traditional cotton

Small upgrade, big difference.

**7:00 PM:**
Weekend challenge: Create a "sleep sanctuary"

This weekend, optimize ONE thing:
• Blackout curtains
• White noise machine
• Comfortable pillow
• Room temperature

Small changes = big impact. Share what you'll improve!

### Saturday — Lifestyle & Wellness

**9:00 AM:**
Sleep isn't isolated — it's connected to everything.

Today: Focus on daytime habits that improve nighttime sleep:
• Morning sunlight within 30 min of waking
• Regular exercise (finish 3+ hours before bed)
• Hydration (taper off before bedtime)
• Stress management throughout day

**12:00 PM:**
For new parents: Survival sleep tips

1. Sleep when baby sleeps (cliché but true)
2. Tag-team nights with partner
3. Accept help when offered
4. Lower expectations temporarily

This phase passes. Your sleep will return.

**3:00 PM:**
Meditation for sleep beginners:

Try "body scan" meditation:
1. Lie in bed
2. Focus attention on toes
3. Slowly move up body
4. Notice sensations without judgment

5 minutes can calm racing thoughts.

**7:00 PM:**
Saturday night tip: Alcohol might help you fall asleep faster, but...

It disrupts REM sleep (the restorative stage) and causes fragmented sleep later.

If drinking: Limit to 1-2 drinks, finish 3+ hours before bed, drink extra water.

### Sunday — Reflection & Community

**9:00 AM:**
Sunday reflection: How was your sleep this week?

Instead of focusing on "bad" nights, celebrate the wins:

Progress, not perfection.
