## Post 1: r/sleep — Value Post (No direct link)

**Title:** I finally figured out why I was waking up groggy — it's all about sleep cycles

**Body:**
I used to think 8 hours = good sleep. Wrong.

After doing some research, I learned that sleep happens in ~90 minute cycles. If your alarm goes off in the MIDDLE of a cycle (especially deep sleep), you feel like garbage. But if you wake up at the END of a cycle, you feel refreshed.

So instead of just aiming for 8 hours, I started counting backwards in 90-minute blocks from when I needed to wake up.

Example: Need to wake at 7am? Count back in 90-min cycles:
- 6 cycles = 9 hours = go to bed at 10pm
- 5 cycles = 7.5 hours = go to bed at 11:30pm
- 4 cycles = 6 hours = go to bed at 1am

Add ~15 min to fall asleep, so actually get in bed 15 min earlier.

Game changer. Been waking up before my alarm now.

Anyone else notice this?

**Title:** LPT: Calculate your bedtime based on sleep cycles, not hours

**Body:**
Most people aim for "8 hours of sleep" but wake up tired anyway.

Here's why: Sleep happens in 90-minute cycles. If you wake up mid-cycle, you'll feel groggy (sleep inertia). If you wake up between cycles, you feel alert.

**Quick math:**
- Figure out when you need to wake up
- Count backwards in 90-minute blocks
- Add 15 minutes to fall asleep
- That's your ideal bedtime

For a 6:30am wake up:
- 5 cycles (7.5h) + 15min = 10:45pm bedtime
- 6 cycles (9h) + 15min = 9:15pm bedtime

There are free sleep calculators online that do this math for you if you don't want to calculate it yourself.

## Post 3: r/sleep — Question/Discussion

**Title:** What time do you go to bed vs what time do you actually fall asleep?

**Body:**
I've been tracking my sleep lately and realized there's usually a 10-20 minute gap between when I get in bed and when I actually fall asleep.

This matters if you're trying to time your sleep cycles properly. Most sleep calculators assume ~14 minutes to fall asleep, but I'm curious if that's accurate for most people.

What's your experience? Do you fall asleep quickly or does it take a while?

## Post 4: r/selfimprovement — Story Format

**Title:** Small change that improved my mornings: timing sleep cycles

**Body:**
I've been working on my morning routine for months. Tried everything — cold showers, no phone, meditation. Still felt tired.

Then I learned about sleep cycles and realized I was probably waking up at the wrong time.

Started using a sleep calculator to figure out when to go to bed based on when I needed to wake up. The idea is to wake up at the END of a sleep cycle rather than in the middle.

First week: noticed I was waking up slightly before my alarm
Second week: morning grogginess basically gone
Now: I actually look forward to mornings

It's not magic, it's just math. 90-minute cycles, count backwards from your wake time, add 15 min to fall asleep.

Simple but effective.

## Post 5: r/LifeProTips — Direct Tip

**Title:** LPT: If you wake up tired even after 8 hours, you're probably waking up mid-sleep-cycle

**Body:**
Your brain cycles through light sleep → deep sleep → REM roughly every 90 minutes. Waking up during deep sleep = feeling like death. Waking up after completing a cycle = feeling refreshed.

**The fix:** Instead of sleeping "8 hours," aim for complete cycles:
- 4 cycles = 6 hours
- 5 cycles = 7.5 hours  
- 6 cycles = 9 hours

Add ~15 min to fall asleep when calculating your bedtime.

This is why sometimes 6 hours feels better than 7 — you completed 4 full cycles instead of waking up mid-cycle.

## Posting Strategy

1. **Never post links in the main post** — Reddit hates that
2. **Only mention the site if someone asks** — "there are sleep calculators online" or share link in comments if directly asked
3. **Space posts out** — 1-2 per week max across different subreddits
4. **Engage genuinely** — Reply to comments, be helpful
5. **Build karma first** — Comment helpfully on other posts before posting your own
