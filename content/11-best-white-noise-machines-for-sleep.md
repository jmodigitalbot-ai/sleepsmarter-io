## Why Use a White Noise Machine?

Before diving into our picks, let's understand why white noise machines work so well for sleep:

### The Science Behind White Noise

White noise contains all frequencies of sound at equal intensity, creating a consistent audio blanket that:

- **Masks disruptive sounds** — Traffic, snoring partners, noisy neighbors, and barking dogs get drowned out
- **Reduces the "startle" response** — Sudden noises are less jarring against a steady background
- **Creates a sleep association** — Your brain learns to associate the sound with sleep time
- **Helps you fall asleep faster** — Studies show white noise can reduce sleep onset by up to 38%

If you're someone who [wakes up tired](/blog/why-do-i-wake-up-tired) despite getting enough hours, environmental noise might be fragmenting your sleep cycles without you realizing it.

### Who Benefits Most?

- **Light sleepers** who wake at every sound
- **City dwellers** dealing with traffic and street noise
- **Parents** with babies on unpredictable schedules
- **Shift workers** sleeping during daytime hours
- **People with tinnitus** who need sound masking
- **Remote workers** needing office privacy

### Key Features to Consider

4. **Portability** — Will you travel with it?
5. **Power Source** — Battery, USB, or AC?
6. **Smart Features** — Do you want app control or sunrise alarms?

### Price Expectations

- **Budget ($15-30):** Basic but functional. Good for trying out white noise.
- **Mid-Range ($30-60):** Best value. Quality sounds and useful features.
- **Premium ($100+):** Smart features, premium design, all-in-one solutions.

## White Noise Machine vs. Alternatives

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|

| **Phone App** | Free, always with you | Drains battery, notifications |
