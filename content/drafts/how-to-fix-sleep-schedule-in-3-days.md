## Understanding Sleep Disruption

Before diving into the fix, let's understand why your sleep schedule gets off track:

### What Causes Sleep Schedule Chaos?

- **Irregular work hours**
- **Jet lag**
- **Stress and anxiety**
- **Technology and blue light exposure**

- **Medical conditions**

### The Science of Circadian Rhythm

Your body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) is controlled by:

When these systems are out of sync, your sleep suffers.
