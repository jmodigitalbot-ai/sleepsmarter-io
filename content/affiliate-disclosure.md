## How We Keep Sleep Smarter Free

Sleep Smarter is committed to helping you get better sleep — and we provide our sleep calculator and educational content completely free of charge.

To support our work, we participate in affiliate programs. This means we may earn a commission when you click on certain links and make a purchase — at no extra cost to you.

## What This Means for You

- **We only recommend products we believe in.** Our recommendations are based on research, user reviews, and sleep science — not commission rates.
- **You pay the same price.** Affiliate links don't increase your cost. The retailer pays us a small referral fee from their marketing budget.
- **Our content is honest.** We'll never recommend a product just because it pays well. Our reputation depends on your trust.

## Our Affiliate Partners

We may earn commissions from the following types of products and services:

- Mattresses and bedding
- Pillows and sleep accessories
- Sleep tracking devices
- Books and courses about sleep

## FTC Disclosure

In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR Part 255, we disclose that we receive compensation from companies whose products we review or recommend. This compensation may influence which products we write about and where they appear on our site, but it does not affect our honest opinions and recommendations.

## Questions?

If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or recommendations, please contact us. We're committed to transparency and helping you make informed decisions about your sleep health.
