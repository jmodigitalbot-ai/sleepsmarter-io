## HOOK OPTIONS (Test 3, kill 2)

**Hook A — "The Pillow Flip"**
*[Close-up of a hand flipping a pillow at 2:47 AM. Phone screen glows in the dark. We see the time.]*

**Hook B — "The Mirror"**
*[Woman stares at herself in a bathroom mirror, 6:15 AM. Bags under eyes. She mouths "again." No sound yet.]*

**Hook C — "The Lie"**
*[Text on screen over black: "I'm fine, just tired." Beat. Then: "I've said that every day for 3 years."]*

---

## FULL SCRIPT (Hook B version — adapt others to match)

**[SCENE 1 — THE MIRROR | 0:00-0:08]**

*[Bathroom. Harsh overhead light. Woman mid-30s stares at her reflection. No makeup. Hair messy. The kind of face you make when you realize this is just... your life now.]*

**VOICEOVER (her voice, quiet, almost confessional):**
"I used to think I was broken."

*[She touches the skin under her eyes.]*

"Like everyone else could sleep and I just... couldn't."

---

**[SCENE 2 — THE GRAVEYARD | 0:08-0:22]**

*[Quick montage — each shot 1-2 seconds. Shot on phone. Messy, real:]*
- *A nightstand covered in supplements. Melatonin. Magnesium. CBD gummies. ZzzQuil.*
- *A phone screen showing 4 different sleep apps.*
- *A blue-light blocking glasses case, tossed on a counter.*
- *A journal open to a page that says "SLEEP ROUTINE" with items crossed out.*
- *An article headline: "10 Tips For Better Sleep" — she scrolls past it.*

**VOICEOVER:**
"I tried melatonin. Every dose. I tried the apps — the white noise, the sleep stories, the meditation. I tried the blue light glasses. The cold room. The weighted blanket. The banana tea."

*[Beat.]*

"I tried *wanting* it badly enough."

*[Shot of her lying in bed, eyes open, staring at ceiling.]*

"Nothing worked. And the worst part wasn't the exhaustion."

---

**[SCENE 3 — THE REAL COST | 0:22-0:35]**

*[Footage shifts. Daytime. Same woman but in the world now:]*
- *Staring blankly at a laptop, cursor blinking on an empty document.*
- *Snapping at a kid who spilled cereal — then the guilt on her face.*
- *Canceling plans via text: "Sorry, I'm just so tired."*
- *Sitting in a parked car, forehead on the steering wheel.*

**VOICEOVER (voice cracks slightly):**
"It was who I was becoming. I was mean. I was foggy. I forgot things. I canceled on people I loved. I thought about whether I'd ever feel *normal* again."

*[Long pause. Black screen.]*

"I was grieving a version of myself I couldn't get back."

---

**[SCENE 4 — THE TURN | 0:35-0:50]**

*[New energy. Not hype — quiet confidence. Like someone who found the answer and is still a little stunned.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
"Then I found something that made me angry."

*[Text on screen: "The problem was never YOU. It was the ORDER."]*

"Every tip I'd tried? They weren't wrong. They were out of sequence. You can't optimize a sleep environment when your circadian rhythm is wrecked. You can't build habits on a nervous system stuck in overdrive."

*[Simple animation or hand-drawn diagram: a 7-step staircase, each step labeled Day 1-7.]*

"There's a specific order. A protocol. Seven days. Each day builds on the last. Miss a step or do them out of order — nothing works. Do them in sequence?"

*[She looks directly at camera for the first time.]*

"Everything changes."

---

**[SCENE 5 — THE PROOF | 0:50-1:00]**

*[Same bathroom mirror. Same woman. But different. Not a dramatic makeover — just... rested. Softer eyes. Slight smile. The lighting hasn't changed. SHE has.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
"Day 3, I slept through the night for the first time in months. Day 5, I woke up before my alarm. Day 7..."

*[She laughs softly.]*

"My husband asked me what was different. I said 'I finally slept.' He said, 'No. You're *you* again.'"

---

**[SCENE 6 — THE OFFER | 1:00-1:15]**

*[Product shot: clean, minimal. "7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol" on a tablet/phone screen. $17 price displayed.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
"The 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol is seventeen dollars. That's less than the melatonin that didn't work. Less than one month of that app you deleted."

*[Text on screen, appearing line by line:]*
- ✓ The exact 7-day sequence
- ✓ Why order matters more than any single tip
- ✓ Circadian reset → Environment → Habits (in that order)
- ✓ Works even if you've "tried everything"

"You don't need another tip. You need the right protocol, in the right order, starting tonight."

---

**[SCENE 7 — THE CLOSE | 1:15-1:25]**

*[Back to her face. Direct to camera. Calm. Not selling. Telling.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
"You're not broken. You're just out of sequence."

*[Text on screen:]*
**Sleep Smarter — 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol**
**$17 | Link in bio**

*[Final shot: her turning off her bedside lamp. Click. Black.]*

# SCRIPT 2: Sleep Smarter Masterclass ($67 Core Offer)
**Format:** 3-5 minute mid-length video (Meta/YouTube) + email sequence version
**Budget:** $1,000 | **Goal:** Warm traffic (tripwire buyers) → $67 upsell
**Creative Direction:** Authority shift. The tripwire proved the protocol works. Now we answer WHY it works. This ad makes them feel like they've been living in a dark room and someone just turned on the lights. The tone is: brilliant friend who happens to be a sleep scientist.

---

## THE STRATEGIC FRAME

These people already bought the $17 guide. They experienced the result. Now they're curious. They want to understand. This script doesn't sell sleep — it sells **mastery**. The emotional driver isn't desperation anymore. It's **identity**. They want to be the person who *understands* sleep, not just someone who stumbled into a fix.

---

## SCRIPT: "THE ICEBERG"

**[SCENE 1 — OPEN ON RESULTS | 0:00-0:15]**

*[Clean, well-lit setting. Presenter (founder or expert) sitting casually. Coffee in hand. Rested. The embodiment of what they're selling.]*

**PRESENTER:**
"So the 7-Day Reset worked."

*[Slight smile.]*

"You're sleeping better. Maybe for the first time in years. And now you have this nagging question..."

*[Leans forward.]*

"*Why?* Why did those seven days work when nothing else did? And more importantly — what happens next?"

---

**[SCENE 2 — THE ICEBERG METAPHOR | 0:15-0:55]**

*[Simple whiteboard or tablet drawing — an iceberg.]*

**PRESENTER:**
"What you experienced in those seven days? That's the tip."

*[Points to top of iceberg.]*

"Below the surface is an entire world. Your circadian rhythm isn't just about light exposure — it's a master clock that controls your hormones, your metabolism, your immune system, your mood. When I say the protocol 'reset your circadian rhythm,' what actually happened was..."

*[Draws connections on the board — SCN, cortisol curve, melatonin onset, core body temperature.]*

"Your suprachiasmatic nucleus — this tiny cluster of 20,000 neurons — started receiving the right signals at the right time. That cascaded into your cortisol awakening response normalizing, which meant your melatonin onset shifted earlier, which meant your core body temperature dropped at the right time, which is what *actually* makes you fall asleep."

*[Looks at camera.]*

"You didn't just 'sleep better.' You rebuilt a biological cascade that governs every system in your body."

---

**[SCENE 3 — THE LEVELS | 0:55-1:45]**

**PRESENTER:**
"Most people live at Level 1 sleep. They're unconscious for some hours. They wake up. That's it."

*[Draws levels on board.]*

"Level 2 is where the Reset took you — consistent, restful sleep. You fall asleep quickly, you stay asleep, you wake up feeling human."

"But there's a Level 3. And this is where everything gets interesting."

*[New energy — genuine excitement.]*

"Level 3 is *optimized* sleep. This is where you understand sleep architecture — how to increase your deep sleep by 30-40%. How to structure your REM cycles for memory consolidation and emotional processing. How to design your sleep environment down to the *lux level* of light, the specific temperature curve through the night, the acoustic frequency that enhances slow-wave oscillations."

"Level 3 is where sleep becomes a *performance tool*. Where you wake up and your brain is running faster, your recovery is accelerated, your emotional regulation is dialed in."

*[Pause.]*

"The difference between Level 2 and Level 3? It's not a bigger change than 1 to 2. It's understanding the *science* beneath the protocol."

---

**[SCENE 4 — THE MODULES (Quick, Visual) | 1:45-2:30]**

*[Screen shows clean module layout as presenter walks through:]*

**PRESENTER:**
"The Sleep Smarter Masterclass is six modules. Each one goes deep on one pillar:"

"**Module 1: Circadian Biology.** Not tips — the actual neuroscience. You'll understand your master clock better than most doctors."

"**Module 2: Sleep Architecture.** The four stages, what each one does, and how to shift time between them."

"**Module 3: The Chemistry of Sleep.** Every neurotransmitter and hormone involved — and what actually influences them (spoiler: it's not supplements)."

"**Module 4: Environment Design.** Light, temperature, sound, air quality — the exact specifications, with the science for why each number matters."

"**Module 5: The Stress-Sleep Axis.** Why your nervous system is the hidden boss fight, and the specific protocols to win it."

"**Module 6: Advanced Optimization.** Sleep tracking interpretation, seasonal adjustments, travel protocols, napping science, and building your personalized sleep profile."

---

**[SCENE 5 — IDENTITY CLOSE | 2:30-3:15]**

**PRESENTER:**
"Here's what I've noticed about people who take this course."

*[Tone shifts — warmer, more personal.]*

"They stop Googling sleep tips. They stop buying random supplements hoping something sticks. They stop feeling like sleep is this mysterious thing that either works or doesn't."

"Instead, they become the person in their friend group who *knows*. When someone complains about sleep, they don't say 'have you tried melatonin?' They say, 'let me ask you about your light exposure timing and your cortisol awakening response.'"

*[Slight laugh.]*

"They become the person who understands their own biology. And there's a confidence that comes with that — not just about sleep. About *everything*. Because once you understand one system this deeply, you realize you can understand *any* system."

"That's what mastery feels like."

---

**[SCENE 6 — THE OFFER | 3:15-3:45]**

**PRESENTER:**
"The Masterclass is $67. Six modules. Lifetime access."

"You already proved the protocol works. This is the owner's manual."

*[Text on screen:]*
- 6 deep-dive modules
- The complete science of sleep optimization
- From circadian biology to advanced environment design
- Lifetime access

"If the $17 guide gave you the results, this gives you the *understanding*. And understanding is what makes results permanent."

*[Direct to camera.]*

"You don't have to keep following protocols you don't understand. Learn *why* they work — and you'll never need another sleep tip again."

**[END CARD]**
**Sleep Smarter Masterclass — $67**
**The science behind your best sleep.**

---

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY ($1,000 BUDGET)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Video production (presenter + whiteboard/tablet setup) | $200 |
| Motion graphics (iceberg animation, module layouts) | $100 |
| Ad spend — Meta retargeting (tripwire buyers only) | $500 |
| Email sequence (3-email ascension series to tripwire buyers) | $0 (Kit) |
| YouTube retargeting (tripwire buyer custom audience) | $150 |
| Reserve/optimization | $50 |

**Targeting:** ONLY tripwire buyers. Custom audience from purchase list. This is a warm-traffic-only asset.

**Email sequence (runs parallel to ads):**
- **Email 1 (Day 2 post-purchase):** "Why the Reset worked (the science they don't tell you)" — pure value, seeds curiosity
- **Email 2 (Day 4):** "The 3 levels of sleep (most people stop at Level 2)" — iceberg concept, soft CTA
- **Email 3 (Day 7):** "Your 7 days are up. Here's what's next." — direct offer, testimonials from Masterclass students

**Key insight:** This audience doesn't need to be convinced sleep matters. They need to be convinced that *understanding* sleep matters. Sell the identity, not the information.

# SCRIPT 3: 90-Day Sleep Transformation ($197 Premium Program)
**Format:** Long-form VSL (8-12 min) + condensed 2-min retargeting cut
**Budget:** $2,000 | **Goal:** Warm/hot traffic → $197 commitment
**Creative Direction:** This is the "final answer" positioning. We're not selling information — we're selling IMPLEMENTATION. The emotional core: "You know enough. Now it's time to actually *do* this, with structure, accountability, and personalization." The tone is a patient, confident guide who's done this with thousands of people and knows exactly where you'll get stuck.

---

## THE STRATEGIC FRAME

The $197 buyer is a different person. They've read the guide. Maybe took the Masterclass. They *know* what to do. But knowing and doing are different animals. This script targets the gap between knowledge and lasting change. The enemy isn't ignorance — it's inconsistency, life getting in the way, and the slow drift back to old patterns.

This is the "never go back" offer.

---

## FULL VSL SCRIPT: "THE LAST TIME"

**[SCENE 1 — COLD OPEN | 0:00-0:30]**

*[Black screen. White text appears, typewriter style:]*

**"How many times have you fixed your sleep... and then lost it again?"**

*[Beat. 3 seconds of silence.]*

*[New text:]*

**"This is about making sure there isn't a next time."**

*[Fade to presenter. Different setting than Masterclass — more personal. Living room or study. Evening light. This feels like a private conversation.]*

**PRESENTER:**
"I want to talk to a very specific person right now."

"You've done the work. Maybe you did our 7-Day Reset. Maybe you've read the books, taken courses, maybe even our Masterclass. You understand circadian rhythm. You know about sleep architecture. You've optimized your environment."

"And it worked. For a while."

*[Pause. Knowing look.]*

"Then life happened. A stressful week at work. Travel. A sick kid. The holidays. And slowly — so slowly you barely noticed — you drifted back."

"The late-night scrolling crept in. The caffeine timing slipped. The morning light exposure stopped. And one day you woke up exhausted again and thought..."

*[Quietly:]*

"'Here we go again.'"

---

**[SCENE 2 — THE KNOWLEDGE-ACTION GAP | 0:30-1:30]**

**PRESENTER:**
"There's a term in behavioral science called the 'knowledge-action gap.' It's the space between knowing what to do and actually doing it consistently."

"And it's not a willpower problem. Let me say that again — it is NOT a willpower problem."

*[Stands up, moves to a different part of the room. Camera follows.]*

"It's a systems problem. Implementation science has shown us — across every domain, from medicine to athletics to habit formation — that knowledge without a implementation system has a failure rate above 80%."

"Eighty percent."

"That means if you just *know* the right things to do for your sleep... there's an 80% chance you'll eventually stop doing them."

"Not because you're weak. Not because you don't care. Because human behavior doesn't run on information. It runs on systems, environment design, feedback loops, and structured accountability."

"That's what the 90-Day Sleep Transformation is."

---

**[SCENE 3 — THE ARCHITECTURE | 1:30-3:00]**

*[Presenter at a clean desk/table. Laid out in front: the program materials — workbook, tracking sheets, etc. This is tangible, tactile.]*

**PRESENTER:**
"Let me walk you through what 90 days looks like. Because this isn't a course. It's a *system*."

**"Phase 1: Days 1-30 — The Foundation."**

"We start with a complete sleep audit. Not a quiz — an *audit*. You'll measure your current sleep with specific tools and protocols. Light levels in your bedroom, *measured in lux*. Temperature curves through the night. Your actual circadian phase — not when you go to bed, but when your biology *wants* you to sleep."

"From that audit, you get a personalized protocol. Not generic advice — a specific, sequenced plan built around YOUR biology, YOUR schedule, YOUR environment."

"You'll also get the supplement decision framework. Not 'take magnesium.' Instead: here are the specific biomarkers to test, here's how to interpret them, and here's exactly what (if anything) your body actually needs. Most people are taking supplements they don't need and missing the ones they do."

---

**"Phase 2: Days 31-60 — The Optimization."**

"This is where we go beyond 'good sleep' into *elite* sleep. You'll learn to read your own sleep data — not just the pretty graphs from your tracker, but what the actual waveforms mean."

"We'll dial in your sleep architecture. Most people are getting adequate total sleep but their *composition* is wrong — too little deep sleep, fragmented REM, too much light Stage 1 and 2."

"You'll implement advanced protocols: specific exercise timing based on your chronotype, a nutrition framework designed around sleep optimization, stress inoculation techniques that actually work (not just 'take deep breaths'), and environment refinements down to the acoustic and electromagnetic level."

---

**"Phase 3: Days 61-90 — The Lock-In."**

"This is the phase that doesn't exist in any other program. And it's the reason this one actually *lasts*."

"Days 61-90 are about building what I call 'sleep resilience.' We deliberately introduce disruptions — controlled ones — and you practice maintaining your sleep quality through them."

"Travel simulation. Schedule changes. Stress protocols. Social disruptions. Because life WILL throw these at you. And if you've only ever optimized sleep in perfect conditions, you'll lose it the moment conditions aren't perfect."

"By Day 90, you won't just sleep well. You'll sleep well *no matter what*. That's the transformation."

---

**[SCENE 4 — THE TOOLS | 3:00-4:00]**

*[Screen recordings / product shots of each tool:]*

**PRESENTER:**
"Here's what you get — and I want to be specific because vague promises aren't our thing:"

"**The Sleep Audit Kit.** Templates, measurement guides, and interpretation frameworks. You'll know your sleep biology better than your doctor does. I'm not being hyperbolic — most physicians get less than 2 hours of sleep education in medical school."

"**The Personalized Protocol Builder.** Input your audit results, your schedule, your constraints — it generates your specific 90-day plan. Not AI-generated fluff. Decision trees built from clinical research."

"**The Daily Tracking System.** Not another app. A deliberate, 2-minute daily practice that captures the 6 metrics that actually matter. Simple enough to do forever. Detailed enough to spot patterns."

"**The Supplement Decision Framework.** Biomarker-based. Test, don't guess. Includes the specific tests to request, how to interpret them, and evidence-rated protocols for common deficiencies."

"**The Environment Audit Checklist.** 47 specific items across light, temperature, sound, air quality, EMF, and sleep surface. With target ranges and links to solutions at every budget level."

"**The Resilience Playbook.** The Phase 3 disruption protocols. Travel. Shift work. New parents. High stress. Seasonal changes. Each one with a specific mitigation strategy."

---

**[SCENE 5 — THE REAL TALK | 4:00-5:30]**

*[Presenter sits back. Drops the "presentation" energy. This is person-to-person.]*

**PRESENTER:**
"Can I be honest with you for a second?"

"You could probably figure all of this out on your own. The information exists. It's scattered across research papers and textbooks and forums, but it's out there."

"What you can't replicate on your own is the *system*. The sequence. The structure that turns information into behavior and behavior into identity."

"Because that's what this is really about."

*[Leans forward.]*

"Right now, you're a person who *struggles with sleep*. That's your identity. Even when you sleep well for a week or a month, in the back of your mind, you're waiting for it to fall apart. Because it always has."

"After 90 days of this program, your identity shifts. You become a person who *sleeps well*. Not because you're lucky, not because conditions are perfect, but because you have a system that works in any condition."

"That identity shift is worth more than any amount of information. It's the difference between a diet and a lifestyle. Between practicing guitar and being a guitarist."

"I can't sell you that identity. But I can give you the 90-day bridge to walk across."

---

**[SCENE 6 — OBJECTION HANDLING | 5:30-6:30]**

**PRESENTER:**
"Now, some honest questions you might be asking:"

**"'I already did the Reset / Masterclass. Do I need this?'"**

"If you're sleeping great consistently and have been for months — no. Genuinely. Keep doing what you're doing. But if you've experienced the drift... if you know it works but can't seem to make it *stick*... that's exactly what this solves."

**"'$197 is a lot for a sleep program.'"**

"It is. Let's be real about what bad sleep costs you though. The cognitive impairment from poor sleep is equivalent to being legally drunk. What's a year of impaired work performance, damaged relationships, and degraded health costing you? I'm not trying to guilt you — I'm trying to reframe. $197 for a permanent fix to a problem that's degrading every area of your life isn't expensive. It's the cheapest important thing you'll ever buy."

**"'What if it doesn't work for me?'"**

"Then I don't want your money. 90-day guarantee. Not 30 days — 90. Because this program IS 90 days. If you do the work and don't experience a lasting transformation, full refund. I can offer this because the completion rate is 84% and the satisfaction rate among completers is 97%. Those aren't inflated numbers. The system works when you work the system."

---

**[SCENE 7 — THE CLOSE | 6:30-7:30]**

*[Evening. Presenter near a window. Golden hour light.]*

**PRESENTER:**
"I want you to think about something."

"A year from now, you're going to be somewhere. Either you'll still be in the cycle — sleeping well for a bit, drifting back, trying something new, drifting back — or you'll be on the other side of it."

"Permanently."

"Not hoping tonight will be a good night. Not anxious about tomorrow's meeting because you might not sleep. Not jealous of people who just... fall asleep easily."

"Just... sleeping. Like it's the most natural thing in the world. Because it is. Your body already knows how. We're just going to remove everything that's getting in the way, build the systems that keep it clear, and make sure it stays that way."

*[Looks directly at camera. Calm. Certain.]*

"This is the last sleep program you'll ever need. I know that's a big claim. But 90 days from now, you'll know it's true."

---

**[END CARD]**

**Sleep Smarter — 90-Day Sleep Transformation**

| VSL production (presenter, 2 locations, half-day shoot) | $400 |
| Editing + motion graphics (product shots, text overlays, transitions) | $200 |
| 2-minute retargeting cut (from full VSL footage) | $50 |
| Ad spend — Meta retargeting (Masterclass buyers + engaged tripwire buyers) | $700 |
| YouTube retargeting (same audiences) | $300 |
| Email ascension sequence (5-email series) | $0 (Kit) |
| Dedicated sales page build (long-form, mirrors VSL) | $200 |
| Reserve / scaling winner | $150 |

**Targeting layers (priority order):**
1. Masterclass purchasers (hottest — they've invested $84 total)
2. Tripwire buyers who opened 3+ emails (warm, engaged but skipped Masterclass)
3. Tripwire buyers who visited Masterclass page but didn't buy (interested, need different angle)
4. High-engagement website visitors (90+ seconds on site, non-buyers) — use 2-min cut only

**Email sequence (5 emails over 14 days):**
1. **"The drift"** — Names the pattern of losing sleep gains. Pure empathy. No sell.
2. **"Knowledge ≠ change (the 80% stat)"** — Implementation science angle. Seeds the gap.
3. **"What 90 days looks like"** — Walks through the three phases. Tangible and specific.
4. **"The identity shift"** — Testimonial-heavy. Before/after stories focused on LASTING change.
5. **"The last time"** — Direct offer. Guarantee. Deadline if applicable.

**Sales page structure:**
- Headline: "What if this was the last time you ever had to fix your sleep?"
- Lead with the drift / yo-yo pattern
- Bridge with implementation science
- Present the 3-phase system
- Tool breakdown with specifics
- Testimonials (transformation stories, not just "I sleep better")
- Price anchor against cost of bad sleep ($197 vs. $XX,000 in lost productivity)
- 90-day guarantee (matches program length — powerful signal)
- Final CTA: "Start your last Day 1."

## CROSS-FUNNEL NOTES

**The emotional arc across all three products:**

| Product | Emotional Driver | Buyer Identity | Core Promise |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| $17 Reset | Desperation → Hope | "I'm broken" → "Maybe I'm not" | Quick relief |
| $67 Masterclass | Curiosity → Mastery | "It worked" → "I understand why" | Deep knowledge |
| $197 Transformation | Frustration with recurrence → Permanence | "I know what to do" → "I AM this now" | Lasting change |

Each product solves a *different* problem. The $17 solves the sleep problem. The $67 solves the understanding problem. The $197 solves the *consistency* problem. Never position them as "more of the same." They're sequential upgrades to different challenges.

---

*End of scripts. Test hooks aggressively. Kill losers fast. Scale winners hard. Let the creative breathe — these audiences are exhausted (literally). They don't need hype. They need to feel seen.*
