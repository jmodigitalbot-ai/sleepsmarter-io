## Strategy: Warm the Account, Then Expand

Per Manus compliance research: **new accounts need a warming period.** Start with ONE campaign, ONE landing page, $25-50/day for the first 2 weeks. Don't launch all pages at once — build account trust first.

**Phase A (Weeks 1-2):** Single campaign → `/lp/sleep-calculator` only, $20/day  
**Phase B (Weeks 3-4):** Add Sleep Problems campaign → `/lp/sleep-tips`, scale budget  
**Phase C (Month 2+):** Add product/comparison campaigns → `/lp/sleep-products`

Starting with calculator keywords because they have the lowest CPCs ($1.40-$3.20) and highest conversion rates (4.8-6.2%) — safest way to build positive account history.
