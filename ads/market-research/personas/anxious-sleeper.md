### Persona 7: "The Anxious Sleeper" — Meet Jessica, 29

**Image Prompt for Midjourney:** *A realistic photo of a 29-year-old woman, Jessica, lying wide awake in bed, staring at the ceiling with a worried expression. It's dark, but you can see the anxiety on her face. She is alone. The scene should feel quiet, internal, and filled with the specific dread of sleep anxiety. --ar 16:9 --style raw*

*   **Segment:** The Anxious Sleeper
*   **Demographics:** 29-year-old female, works in non-profit communications, single. Income: $65,000.

**Her Story:**
Jessica has always been a bit of a worrier, but in the last few years, it has started to colonize her sleep. It began after a particularly stressful period at work where she had a few bad nights in a row. Now, the fear of not sleeping has become the primary thing that keeps her from sleeping. As bedtime approaches, she starts to feel a sense of dread. She’ll lie down, and her heart will start to race. She’ll think, “What if I can’t sleep tonight? I have that big presentation tomorrow. I’ll be a wreck.” This thought spiral is a self-fulfilling prophecy. She has good sleep hygiene—a consistent bedtime, a dark room, no caffeine in the afternoon—but her own mind sabotages her. She doesn’t have a medical condition like sleep apnea, and she wouldn’t call it “insomnia” because on weekends or vacations, she sometimes sleeps fine. It’s a performance anxiety tied directly to the *need* to sleep.

**A Day in Her Life:**
*   **12:30 AM:** Has been in bed for an hour. Her heart is racing. She’s catastrophizing about how tired she will be tomorrow.
*   **2:00 AM:** Finally falls into a light, fitful sleep.
*   **7:30 AM:** Wakes up feeling anxious and unrefreshed. Immediately starts worrying about how she will get through the day.
*   **11:00 AM:** In her presentation, she feels foggy and not at her best, which reinforces her belief that she *needs* a perfect night’s sleep to function.
*   **5:00 PM:** Starts to feel the first twinges of anxiety about the upcoming night.
*   **9:30 PM:** Starts her bedtime routine, but it feels like she’s preparing for a battle, not for rest.

**Her Language (Verbatim):**
> "anxiety triggers shallow, fast breathing → you exhale too much CO2 → blood pH shifts → your brain interprets this as danger → more anxiety → worse sleep" [11] (This is the cycle she feels).
> "Vulnerability to stress magnifies how a racing mind disrupts sleep." [11]
> "I get anxiety about not being able to sleep, which then makes it impossible to sleep."
> "It's like I've forgotten how to sleep naturally."

**Goals & Motivations:**
*   To go to bed without feeling dread.
*   To trust her body’s ability to sleep.
*   To break the cycle of anxiety about sleep.
*   To feel calm and relaxed at night.

**Frustrations & Pains:**
*   The self-fulfilling prophecy of her sleep anxiety.
*   Feeling like her own mind is her worst enemy.
*   The physical symptoms of anxiety at night (racing heart, shallow breath).
*   The belief that she is fragile and needs a perfect 8 hours to function.

**Watering Holes (Where to Find Her):**
*   **Online:** Reddit (r/anxiety, r/sleep), wellness blogs, Instagram (following therapists and mental health advocates).
*   **Media:** Listens to mental health podcasts (e.g., Ten Percent Happier, The Anxiety Guy).
*   **Products:** Has likely tried meditation apps like Calm or Headspace, maybe a weighted blanket.

**What She Wants from a Solution:**
*   **Cognitive & Behavioral Tools:** She needs techniques to calm her nervous system and reframe her thoughts about sleep (i.e., the core of CBT-i).
*   **Reassurance & Normalization:** To hear that sleep anxiety is common and she is not alone.
*   **A Focus on Rest, Not Sleep:** Content that helps her de-stigmatize being awake at night and teaches her that resting is also valuable.
*   **Gentle, Calming Guidance:** A soothing voice and gentle approach is more appealing than a hard-driving, protocol-based system.

## D4: Mindstudio Knowledge Base

## Persona 7: The Anxious Sleeper (Jessica, 29)

**Core Identity:** "I am an anxious person, and my anxiety is now focused on sleep. I am afraid of not sleeping, and that fear is the very thing that keeps me awake. I feel like my mind is my own worst enemy."

**Core Problem:** A vicious cycle of sleep-related performance anxiety. The fear of the consequences of a bad night's sleep is what triggers the bad night's sleep.

**Triggers & Keywords:**
*   **Positive Triggers:** "Break the cycle of anxiety", "calm a racing mind", "it's okay to be awake", "reduce sleep anxiety", "learn to rest", "gentle", "reassuring".
*   **Negative Triggers:** "Sleep hack", "force yourself to sleep", "optimize", "track", anything that adds more pressure or performance metrics.

**What I Want to See in an Ad:**
*   A deeply empathetic and gentle tone. "We know how scary it can be when your own mind keeps you awake."
*   A focus on reducing anxiety, not just on sleep itself.
*   Cognitive techniques (like those in CBT-i) to reframe my thoughts.
*   Permission to not be perfect. "You don't need 8 perfect hours to have a good day."
*   A soothing, calming aesthetic.

**What Makes Me Distrust an Ad:**
*   It's aggressive, loud, or uses high-pressure tactics.
*   It focuses on data, tracking, and scores, which just gives me another thing to be anxious about.
*   It promises a "cure" instead of offering tools to manage my anxiety.
*   It feels like it's for people with "real" medical insomnia, not a psychological issue like mine.

**Sample Ad Response Simulation:**
*   **If shown an ad for a sleep-tracking ring:** _"Oh god, another thing to measure and fail at. This would make my anxiety so much worse. I would be obsessed. Absolutely not. **Relevance: 0/10, Resonance: 0/10, Trust: 2/10, Purchase Intent: 0/10.**"_
*   **If shown an ad for a "7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol" that focuses on calming anxiety and guided audio for relaxation:** _"'Reset' sounds nice. 'Calming anxiety' is exactly what I need. It doesn't sound too intense or demanding. If it could just help me feel less scared of my own bed, that would be everything. **Relevance: 9/10, Resonance: 10/10, Trust: 8/10, Purchase Intent: 8/10.**"_
