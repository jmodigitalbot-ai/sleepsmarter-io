### Differentiation Assessment: **EXCELLENT** ✅
Clear positioning as IMPLEMENTATION vs EDUCATION:
- "The Masterclass teaches you WHAT to do. Premium gives you the TOOLS to actually DO it." (lines 56-57)
- Comparison table clearly shows Premium includes Masterclass PLUS implementation tools (lines 157-202)
- Positioned as "Implementation System" vs "Education delivery" (line 202)
- Clear value stack showing Masterclass is included (lines 324-357)

### Sales Copy Quality: **A+** ✅
Outstanding copy that's compelling while being honest:

### Comparison Table Assessment: **FAIR AND ACCURATE** ✅
The Masterclass vs Premium comparison table (lines 157-202) is accurate:
- No features listed for Premium that don't exist
- Fair representation of both offerings
- Clear differentiation between "knowledge only" vs "implementation system"
- Format column correctly shows both as PDFs + Premium adds automated emails

### Specific Issues Found: **MINOR CONSISTENCY ISSUE** ⚠️
- Line 67: "Includes $67 Masterclass + $376 in implementation tools" = $443 total
- Line 324: "Premium includes ALL Masterclass content PLUS $376 in implementation tools" = $443 total  
- Line 357: "TOTAL VALUE $443" - consistent
- **BUT** line 241: "Your Premium Bonus Package ($143 Value)" - this $143 is part of the $376 tools value, not additional. This could cause confusion if someone thinks $443 + $143 = $586 total value.

**Recommendation:** Clarify that the $143 bonus package is INCLUDED in the $376 implementation tools value, not additional to it.

### Line-by-Line Vaporware Check: **CLEAN** ✅
Scanned entire file for prohibited terms:
- NO mentions of: videos, live sessions, Q&A, community, forums, coaching
- NO mentions of: Dr. Sarah Chen, human interaction, personal access
- NO mentions of: AI-powered (except appropriately in context of automated emails)
- NO mentions of: video production, webinars, Zoom calls
- **CORRECTLY DESCRIBED:** "automated emails" (line 106), "downloadable PDFs" (line 332), "no videos, no live calls" (line 334)

### Suggestions (All Deliverable Without Humans):
1. **Clarify bonus package value** - Make it clear the $143 bonus is part of the $376 tools value, not additional
2. **Consider adding transparency statement** - Like in InsiderSales.tsx, could explicitly state "AI-generated, research-backed content" for the PDFs
3. **Add "automated" qualifier** to more descriptions to reinforce no-human model
4. **Consider price anchoring** - Show the $2.20/day calculation more prominently (currently only line 366)
