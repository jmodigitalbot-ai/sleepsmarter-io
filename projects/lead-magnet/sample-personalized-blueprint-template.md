## 🚀 TONIGHT'S QUICK WINS

### ⭐ ACTION 1: Digital Sunset Protocol
**Start Time:** 8:30 PM (60 minutes before bed)  
**Your Specific Trigger:** Instagram scrolling after dinner

**Steps:**
1. **8:30 PM:** Enable Night Shift/Blue Light Filter (100% intensity)
2. **8:45 PM:** Switch phone to grayscale mode (Settings → Accessibility)
3. **9:00 PM:** Charge phone in kitchen (not bedroom)
4. **9:15 PM:** Listen to sleep podcast on Bluetooth speaker

**Why This Works for You:**  
Breaks the Instagram → racing thoughts → sleep anxiety cycle detected in your pattern.

### ⭐ ACTION 2: 4-7-8 Breathing + Body Scan
**Start Time:** 9:20 PM (10 minutes before bed)

**Technique:**
1. Lie in bed with eyes closed
2. 4-7-8 breathing: Inhale 4s → Hold 7s → Exhale 8s (4 cycles)
3. Body scan: Focus attention from toes to head (3 minutes)
4. Mental note: "Screen is away, mind can rest"

**Personalized Tip:**  
Your pattern shows anxiety peaks at 9:15-9:30 PM. This protocol disrupts that cycle.
