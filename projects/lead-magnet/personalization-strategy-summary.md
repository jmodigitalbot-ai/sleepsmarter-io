3. **Set up n8n instance** and create webhook for ScoreApp
4. **Connect to ConvertKit** for email automation
5. **Launch MVP** to first 100 users for feedback

### Week 2 (Refinement)
1. **Implement persona detection** based on assessment responses
2. **Create content library** with 50+ sleep techniques
3. **Build basic recommendation engine**
4. **Set up analytics tracking** for key metrics
5. **Refine based on initial user feedback**

### Week 3-4 (Personalization Engine)
1. **Integrate Frase** for dynamic content generation
2. **Build advanced recommendation algorithms**
3. **Create personalized follow-up sequences**
4. **Implement A/B testing framework**
5. **Optimize conversion funnel**

## Expected Outcomes

## Technical Requirements

### Software Subscriptions
- **ScoreApp:** $29-99/month (depending on features)
- **Frase:** $45-115/month (depending on usage)
- **n8n:** Self-hosted or cloud ($20-100/month)
- **ConvertKit:** Free up to 1,000 subscribers

### Development Time
- **Phase 1 (2 weeks):** 40-60 hours
- **Phase 2 (2 weeks):** 30-40 hours  
- **Phase 3 (2 weeks):** 20-30 hours
- **Ongoing maintenance:** 2-4 hours/week

### Total Estimated Cost
- **Software:** $100-300/month
- **Development:** 90-130 hours total
- **Content creation:** 20-30 hours
- **Testing/optimization:** 10-20 hours

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Over-engineering:** Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Integration issues:** Use proven platforms with good APIs
- **Performance problems:** Implement caching and optimization
- **Data loss:** Regular backups and recovery procedures

### User Experience Risks
- **Overwhelm:** Provide "simple version" option
- **Privacy concerns:** Clear communication and controls
- **Lack of value:** Continuous testing and refinement
- **Technical barriers:** Simple, intuitive interfaces

### Business Risks
