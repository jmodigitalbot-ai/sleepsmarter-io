# Phase 4: Core Offer Launch (Days 18-22)

**From:** Dr. Sarah Chen <sarah@sleepsmarter.io>
**Goal:** Sell the Sleep Smarter Masterclass ($67)

## EMAIL 18 (Day 18)

**Subject:** I built something for people like you
**Preview:** It's been months in the making

{{first_name}},

Remember when I mentioned I was working on something bigger?

It's ready.

For the past several months, I've been taking everything I know about sleep — the research, the protocols, the techniques that actually work — and organizing it into a comprehensive system.

Not a PDF. Not a blog post. A complete, structured program that takes you from wherever you are now to consistently great sleep.

I'm calling it the **Sleep Smarter Masterclass.**

Here's why I built it:

The Sleep Blueprint is a great starting point. The 7-Day Protocol works for quick fixes. But some people need — and want — the full picture. The deep science. The advanced techniques. The troubleshooting for every edge case.

The emails and articles I send are helpful, but they're scattered. A tip here, a technique there. The Masterclass puts it all in order — a clear path from A to Z.

I'll share the full details tomorrow. But I wanted you to hear about it first, before anyone else. You've been reading my emails and engaging with this content. This was built for people exactly like you.

Talk soon,
Sarah

Here's exactly what's inside the Sleep Smarter Masterclass:

- How sleep cycles actually work (and why most "8 hours" advice is wrong)
- The 4 stages of sleep and what each one does for your body
- How to calculate YOUR ideal sleep duration

**Module 2: Your Chronotype & Ideal Schedule**
- Identify your chronotype (Lion, Bear, Wolf, or Dolphin)
- Build a schedule optimized for YOUR biology
- Work WITH your natural rhythm instead of against it
- Chronotype-specific meal timing, exercise timing, and wind-down routines

**Module 3: Environment Optimization**
- The complete bedroom audit (temperature, light, sound, air quality)
- Product recommendations at every budget level
- The "minimum effective setup" for people who don't want to overhaul everything
- Partner considerations (when you share a bed with a different chronotype)

**Module 4: The Supplement & Nutrition Guide**
- Evidence-based supplements (what works, what doesn't, exact dosages)
- Foods that promote sleep (and foods that destroy it)
- Meal timing for optimal sleep
- Caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis: the honest truth
- My recommended product links for everything mentioned

**Module 5: Stress, Anxiety & The Racing Mind**
- Cognitive techniques for quieting mental chatter
- The "worry journal" method (backed by clinical research)
- Progressive muscle relaxation walkthrough
- Breathing techniques beyond 4-7-8
- When to consider professional help (and what to ask for)

**Module 6: Special Situations**
- Shift work sleep optimization
- New parent survival strategies
- Travel and jet lag protocols
- Aging and sleep changes
- Sleep and fitness performance

**BONUS: Product Recommendation Guide**
My curated list of the best sleep products — pillows, mattresses, sound machines, supplements, light therapy devices — with honest reviews and links.

**Price: $67** (one-time, lifetime access)
**Guarantee: 60 days.** Full refund if you don't see improvement.

This isn't information you can't find online. It's information organized, prioritized, and structured so you don't have to spend months piecing it together yourself. I've done the work. You just follow the path.

## EMAIL 20 (Day 20)

**Subject:** "I wish I found this sooner" — David R.
**Preview:** From 5-hour sleeper to 7.5 hours of quality rest

---

{{first_name}},

David is a 42-year-old project manager with two kids. Here's what he told me:

> *"I'd basically accepted that bad sleep was just part of being a working dad. Everyone around me complained about being tired, so I figured it was normal.*
>
> *I went through the Masterclass on a Sunday afternoon. Module 2 was the game-changer — I realized I'd been fighting my chronotype my entire adult life. I'm a Wolf trying to live a Lion's schedule.*
>
> *Just shifting my bedtime 45 minutes later (counterintuitive, I know) and adjusting my morning routine made a massive difference. I'm actually sleeping 7.5 quality hours now instead of 'trying to get 8' and ending up with 5 hours of tossing.*
>
> *I wish I'd found this sooner. Years of exhaustion because I was following generic advice that didn't fit my biology."*
>
> — David R., Chicago

David's experience highlights something important: **the answer isn't always "more sleep."** Sometimes it's better-timed sleep. Sometimes it's less time in bed but higher quality. Sometimes it's one specific change that unlocks everything else.

The Masterclass helps you find YOUR specific change. Not generic advice. Not what works for "most people." What works for you.

**[Find your specific change → $67](link)**

60-day guarantee. If David's story doesn't become your story, you get your money back.

## EMAIL 21 (Day 21)

**Subject:** What's really included (the full breakdown)
**Preview:** I want you to know exactly what you're getting

---

{{first_name}},

I realize I've talked a lot about what the Masterclass teaches, but I haven't been clear about what you physically GET. Let me fix that:

**When you enroll today, you get:**

📚 **6 Core Modules** — Structured curriculum you can go through at your own pace. Each module is focused and actionable — no filler, no fluff, no 45-minute videos of someone talking at a whiteboard.

📋 **Action Sheets** — Every module includes a one-page action sheet. "Do this, then this, then this." For people who want to skip the explanation and just get the steps.

📊 **Sleep Tracking System** — Templates and a scoring system to measure your progress week over week. Know exactly what's working and what needs adjusting.

💊 **Complete Supplement Guide** — Not just "take magnesium." Exact brands, dosages, timing, interactions, and where to buy. Plus my honest opinion on trendy supplements that don't work.

🛒 **Product Recommendation Guide** — My curated picks for every sleep-related product category, with links. I update this quarterly as new products come out.

🔄 **Lifetime Updates** — When I add new content or update recommendations, you get it automatically. No additional charge.

💬 **Email Access to Me** — Have a question? Reply to any email. I personally respond within 48 hours.

**All of this for $67.** Less than one therapy session. Less than a month of sleep supplements. Less than that weighted blanket collecting dust in your closet.

**[Get Lifetime Access → $67](link)**

60-day money-back guarantee. Zero risk.

## EMAIL 22 (Day 22)

**Subject:** Closing the launch price tomorrow
**Preview:** $67 won't last forever

---

{{first_name}},

Quick note: I've been offering the Sleep Smarter Masterclass at the introductory price of $67. That price is going up to $97 soon.

I'm not doing the fake countdown timer thing. I genuinely underpriced this to get early feedback and testimonials. As the program grows and I add more content, the price will reflect that.

If you've been thinking about it, now is the time.

**What you're getting for $67:**
- ✅ 6 comprehensive modules
- ✅ Action sheets for every module
- ✅ Sleep tracking system
- ✅ Complete supplement guide
- ✅ Product recommendation guide (with affiliate links to best prices)
- ✅ Lifetime updates
- ✅ Direct email access to me
- ✅ 60-day money-back guarantee

**What people typically spend on sleep "solutions" that don't work:**
- Melatonin supplements: $15-30/month ($180-360/year)
- Sleep apps: $50-70/year
- Weighted blankets: $100-200
- Random mattress upgrade: $800-2,000

**Total: $1,000+ on band-aids.**

Or $67 on a system that fixes the root cause.

**[Lock in the $67 price → Enroll now](link)**

After this, I'll shift to talking about something for people who want even more personalized support. But this is the last time I'll pitch the Masterclass for a while.

Your call, {{first_name}}. Either way, I'll keep showing up in your inbox with value.
