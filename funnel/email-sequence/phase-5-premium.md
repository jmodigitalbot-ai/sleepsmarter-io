{{first_name}},

I need to be upfront: today's email is for a specific type of person.

If you're happy with the free tips and articles — great. Keep reading them. They work. You don't need to spend a dime.

If you got the 7-Day Protocol or the Masterclass — amazing. Those are complete systems that will serve you well.

But some people want more. They want:

- A personalized plan built for THEIR life, THEIR schedule, THEIR problems
- Ongoing support, not just a one-time program
- Someone checking in on their progress
- Advanced optimization beyond "the basics"

If that's you, I created the **90-Day Sleep Transformation Program.**

It's the most comprehensive thing I offer, and it's designed for people who are done with "good enough" sleep and want *exceptional* sleep.

I'll share exactly what's included tomorrow. Today I just want to plant the seed:

**If you could have genuinely great sleep — not "okay" sleep, not "better than before" sleep, but wake-up-excited, clear-headed, energized-all-day sleep — every single day for the rest of your life...**

What would that be worth to you?

Hold that number in your mind. I think you'll find tomorrow's email interesting.

Here's what's inside the 90-Day Sleep Transformation Program:

**Everything in the Masterclass, plus:**

🎯 **Personalized Sleep Plan**
Based on a detailed intake assessment, I create a customized 90-day plan for your specific situation. Your chronotype, your work schedule, your health conditions, your goals — all factored in. This isn't generic. It's YOURS.

📧 **Weekly Optimization Emails**
Every week for 90 days, you get a targeted email with your focus for that week. Week 1 might be circadian rhythm. Week 5 might be stress management. Week 10 might be performance optimization. Each builds on the last.

📊 **Monthly Progress Reviews**
At day 30, 60, and 90, we review your sleep data and adjust the plan. What's working stays. What isn't gets modified. This iterative approach is why the results compound.

👥 **Private Community Access**
Connect with other people going through the program. Share wins, ask questions, get support. Having a community of people on the same journey makes a measurable difference in follow-through.

📚 **Advanced Content Library**
Topics beyond the Masterclass: sleep and hormones, sleep and athletic performance, sleep and aging, sleep and creativity, advanced supplement protocols, biohacking techniques.

**Price: $197** (one-time, 90-day program + lifetime community access)
**Guarantee: 60 days.** Full refund if you don't see measurable improvement.

This program has a cap. I limit enrollment because the personalized plans require my attention. When spots fill, I close registration until the next cohort.

## EMAIL 25 (Day 25)

**Subject:** Something new (and different)
**Preview:** A monthly thing I'm testing

{{first_name}},

I've been thinking about what happens AFTER someone fixes their sleep.

The Masterclass teaches you the system. The 90-Day Program transforms your habits. But sleep isn't a "fix it and forget it" thing. Seasons change. Life changes. Stress levels fluctuate. New research comes out.

So I'm testing something: **The Sleep Smarter Insider.**

It's a monthly membership ($19/month) that keeps you optimized long-term:

**What you get each month:**

🔬 **Research Roundup** — I read the sleep journals so you don't have to. I'll distill the latest findings into actionable takeaways.

🛒 **Product Review** — One honest, in-depth review of a sleep product. No sponsorships. Just my genuine opinion after testing.

📅 **Seasonal Sleep Guide** — Your sleep needs change with the seasons. Daylight saving time, summer heat, holiday stress, winter darkness — I'll send a guide for each transition.

💡 **Monthly Optimization Challenge** — One specific thing to try or change each month. Small, focused improvements that compound over time.

👥 **Community Access** — Same community as the Transformation program. Ongoing support and connection.

**Price: $19/month** (cancel anytime, no commitment)

I'm launching this quietly to my email list first. If it resonates, I'll open it up publicly later.

**[Join the Sleep Smarter Insider → $19/mo](link)**

No pressure on this one. It's for people who've already improved their sleep and want to maintain and optimize it over time. If that's not where you are yet, focus on the fundamentals first.

## EMAIL 26 (Day 26)

**Subject:** Your monthly sleep optimization plan
**Preview:** Here's a sample of what members get

---

{{first_name}},

To give you a taste of what Insider members get, here's a sample optimization focus:

**Sample Focus: Light Exposure Optimization**

Most people get dramatically less natural light than their circadian rhythm needs — especially during shorter days or if you work indoors. This is a hidden cause of:
- Difficulty waking up in the morning
- Low energy throughout the day
- Earlier onset of sleepiness (but not better sleep)
- Mild mood changes

**The fix is simple but specific:**

1. Get outside within 30 minutes of waking (even 10 minutes helps)
2. If sunrise is after your wake time, use a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp for 20-30 minutes at breakfast
3. Reduce indoor blue light after sunset (warmer bulbs, screen filters)
4. Optimize your bedroom darkness (blackout curtains are non-negotiable)

Insider members get the full guide with product recommendations, timing protocols for different chronotypes, and troubleshooting.

## EMAIL 27 (Day 27)

**Subject:** What I've learned from 10,000 sleepers
**Preview:** 5 things that surprised me

---

{{first_name}},

After working with thousands of people on their sleep, here are 5 things that still surprise me:

**1. The people who sleep "fine" often benefit the most.**
They don't think they have a problem. They sleep 7 hours, function okay, and assume that's their ceiling. Then they optimize their timing and environment and realize they were operating at 60% when they could be at 90%.

**2. Supplements are almost never the answer.**
I'd estimate that 90% of sleep problems are behavioral or environmental. Supplements should be the last thing you try, not the first. Yet most people start there because it's the easiest change.

**3. Consistency beats everything.**
The single most impactful change anyone can make: same wake time, every day, including weekends. It's boring advice. It's also the closest thing to a sleep miracle that exists.

**4. Cold bedrooms are non-negotiable.**
I've never seen someone switch to 65-67°F and NOT see improvement. It's the closest thing to a universal fix I've found.

**5. People underestimate the compounding effect.**
Week 1 improvements are modest. Week 4 improvements are noticeable. Week 12 improvements are transformational. Sleep optimization compounds like interest. The people who stick with it for 90+ days see results they never expected.

That last point is why I built the 90-Day Transformation Program. Quick fixes are great. But real transformation takes time — and support.

Whatever path you're on — free tips, the Protocol, the Masterclass, or the full program — keep going. It compounds.

## EMAIL 28 (Day 28)

**Subject:** The products that actually work (my honest list)
**Preview:** No sponsorships. Just what I'd buy with my own money.

---

{{first_name}},

People ask me for product recommendations all the time. Here's my honest, unsponsored list — what I'd buy with my own money:

**🛏️ Pillowcase: Silk**
A mulberry silk pillowcase ($30-60) reduces friction, stays cool, and protects your skin and hair. Small upgrade, noticeable difference. → [Our full review](link to silk pillowcase article)

**🔊 Sound: White Noise Machine**
Consistent background sound masks disruptions. I prefer dedicated machines over apps (phone should be out of the bedroom). → [Our top picks](link to white noise article)

**🌡️ Temperature: Cooling Mattress Pad**
If you sleep hot and can't control room temperature, a cooling pad is the best investment. $150-300 but lasts for years.

**💊 Supplement: Magnesium Glycinate**
The one supplement I consistently recommend. 200-400mg, 30-60 minutes before bed. Most people are deficient. Look for glycinate or bisglycinate form — not oxide.

**💡 Light: Light Therapy Lamp (10,000 lux)**
Essential for winter months and people with delayed chronotypes. 20-30 minutes at breakfast. $30-50 for a good one.

**😴 Comfort: Weighted Blanket (optional)**
Works for some people, especially those with anxiety. Try before you commit — they're not for everyone. 10% of your body weight is the rule.

I keep an updated product guide with specific brand recommendations and links in the Masterclass and Insider membership. But these categories are the essentials.

## EMAIL 29 (Day 29)

**Subject:** {{first_name}}, where are you now?
**Preview:** Honest check-in

---

{{first_name}},

It's been almost a month since you downloaded your Sleep Blueprint.

I'm curious — where are you with your sleep?

- Better than before?
- About the same?
- Worse? (It happens — stress, life changes, etc.)

Hit reply and tell me. One sentence is fine. I read every response.

If things have improved, I'd love to know what helped most. Was it the temperature change? The caffeine cutoff? The consistent wake time? Something else?

If things haven't improved, tell me that too. Sometimes the fix is something specific that generic tips don't address. I might be able to point you in the right direction.

Either way, this is the second-to-last email in this sequence. Tomorrow I'll wrap up with a summary of everything we've covered and where to go from here.

Thanks for sticking with me this month, {{first_name}}. It means a lot.
