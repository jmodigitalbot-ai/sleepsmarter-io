## EMAIL 11 (Day 11)

**Subject:** What your sleep score really means
**Preview:** Most people misread this number

---

{{first_name}},

Sleep trackers are everywhere now. Oura rings, Apple Watches, Fitbits — they all give you a "sleep score."

But most people have no idea what that number actually means. Or worse, they stress about it, which — ironically — makes their sleep worse.

Here's what actually matters:

**Sleep Efficiency** = Time asleep ÷ Time in bed × 100

- **Above 85%:** You're doing great
- **75-85%:** Room for improvement
- **Below 75%:** Something needs attention

If you're spending 9 hours in bed but only sleeping 7, your efficiency is 78%. The fix isn't sleeping more — it's spending LESS time in bed. (I know that sounds backwards.)

This is called "sleep restriction therapy," and it's one of the most counterintuitive but effective techniques in sleep medicine.

**The other number that matters: Sleep Latency**

This is how long it takes you to fall asleep.

- **Under 15 minutes:** Ideal
- **15-30 minutes:** Normal
- **Over 30 minutes:** Indicates a problem
- **Under 5 minutes:** You're sleep deprived (your body is crashing, not falling asleep)

If your sleep latency is consistently over 30 minutes, the issue is almost always one of three things: timing (wrong bedtime), environment (too warm, too bright), or arousal (anxious/racing thoughts).

I cover all three in depth here: [Why Do I Wake Up Tired? →](https://sleepsmarter.io/blog/why-do-i-wake-up-tired?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sleep-blueprint-30day&utm_content=day11-why-wake-up-tired)

## EMAIL 12 (Day 12)

**Subject:** The caffeine lie (it's worse than you think)
**Preview:** Your 2 PM coffee is still in your system at midnight

---

{{first_name}},

How long do you think caffeine stays in your system?

Most people guess 4-5 hours. That's the "half-life" you see on Google.

But half-life means half the caffeine is STILL in your body after 5 hours. And it takes **5 half-lives** to fully clear.

Here's what that actually looks like:

**You drink a coffee at 2:00 PM (200mg caffeine):**
- 7:00 PM → 100mg still active
- 12:00 AM → 50mg still active
- 5:00 AM → 25mg still active

At midnight, you still have the equivalent of half a cup of coffee coursing through your system. And you're wondering why you can't fall asleep.

**It gets worse:** As you age, caffeine metabolism slows. A 25-year-old clears caffeine ~40% faster than a 50-year-old. Same cup of coffee, very different impact.

**My rule:** No caffeine after noon. Not 2 PM. Not 1 PM. Noon.

"But Sarah, I NEED my afternoon coffee."

I hear you. Here's what I recommend instead:

1. **Afternoon slump?** Take a 20-minute nap (set an alarm). More effective than caffeine and no sleep disruption.
2. **Need the ritual?** Switch to decaf after noon. Your brain associates the taste with alertness — you'll get a mild placebo effect.
3. **Need actual energy?** 10 minutes of sunlight + a 5-minute walk. Resets your circadian rhythm and gives you 1-2 hours of natural alertness.

I wrote a complete guide to the timing rules that protect your sleep: [The 10-3-2-1-0 Rule →](https://sleepsmarter.io/blog/10-3-2-1-0-sleep-rule?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sleep-blueprint-30day&utm_content=day12-10-3-2-1-0-rule)

## EMAIL 13 (Day 13)

**Subject:** Your sleep is different (and that's okay)
**Preview:** One-size-fits-all sleep advice is mostly wrong

---

{{first_name}},

One thing that drives me crazy about sleep advice: everyone acts like there's ONE right answer.

"Go to bed at 10 PM."
"Get 8 hours."
"Wake up at 6 AM."

This ignores the fact that **people are fundamentally different sleepers.**

Your chronotype — your genetic sleep preference — determines whether you're naturally a morning person, a night owl, or somewhere in between. Fighting your chronotype is like swimming upstream. You can do it, but it's exhausting and mostly pointless.

**The 4 chronotypes:**

🦁 **Lion (Early bird)** — Naturally wakes at 5-6 AM. Peak energy before noon. Crashes by 9 PM. (~15% of people)

🐻 **Bear (Most common)** — Follows the solar cycle. Best energy mid-morning. Ideal bedtime 10-11 PM. (~50% of people)

🐺 **Wolf (Night owl)** — Doesn't really wake up until 9-10 AM. Peak creativity at night. Best bedtime after midnight. (~15% of people)

🐬 **Dolphin (Light sleeper)** — Irregular patterns. Often struggles with insomnia. Needs the most sleep hygiene structure. (~10% of people)

**You can't turn a Wolf into a Lion.** But you CAN optimize a Wolf's schedule so they get incredible sleep within THEIR natural window.

This is why generic sleep advice fails. And why the Sleep Blueprint and the articles on SleepSmarter.io are built around YOUR schedule, not some arbitrary "ideal."

I go deeper on this in our guide: [How Much Sleep Do I Need? →](https://sleepsmarter.io/blog/how-much-sleep-do-i-need?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sleep-blueprint-30day&utm_content=day13-how-much-sleep)

Tomorrow: a number that will make you rethink how you value sleep.

## EMAIL 14 (Day 14)

**Subject:** How I helped 1,000 people sleep better
**Preview:** The patterns I keep seeing

---

{{first_name}},

After working with over a thousand people on their sleep, I've noticed something:

The people who fix their sleep the fastest all do the same three things:

**1. They commit to 7 days minimum**
Not 2 days. Not "I'll try tonight and see." Seven days. Sleep is a system, and systems need time to calibrate. The people who quit after 2 days because "it didn't work yet" never give their body a chance to adjust.

**2. They change their environment, not just their behavior**
Willpower is finite. Environment is permanent. The people who put their phone in another room sleep better than the people who "try not to check it." The people who buy blackout curtains sleep better than the people who "try to ignore the light."

**3. They track their progress**
Not obsessively. But a simple sleep log — bedtime, wake time, how they feel — creates awareness. And awareness creates change. You can't improve what you don't measure.

These three principles are the backbone of everything I teach. They're baked into the Sleep Reset Protocol, and they'll be the foundation of something bigger I'm building right now.

More on that next week. For now — are you tracking your sleep? Even a simple note on your phone each morning makes a difference.

## EMAIL 15 (Day 15)

**Subject:** The 3 sleep types (which one are you?)
**Preview:** Your answer changes everything

---

{{first_name}},

After analyzing patterns from thousands of sleepers, I've identified 3 distinct "sleep problem types." Most people fall clearly into one category:

**Type 1: The Wired Mind 🧠**
- Takes 30+ minutes to fall asleep
- Racing thoughts at bedtime
- Replays the day or worries about tomorrow
- Often checks phone "one more time"
- **Root cause:** Hyperarousal — brain won't downshift

**Type 2: The Broken Clock ⏰**
- Falls asleep fine but wakes at 2-3 AM
- Can't get back to sleep for 30-60 minutes
- OR wakes up way too early
- Tired but "wired" during the night
- **Root cause:** Circadian rhythm disruption

**Type 3: The Zombie 🧟**
- Sleeps 7-8 hours but wakes up exhausted
- Needs multiple alarms
- Heavy caffeine dependence
- Feels foggy until noon
- **Root cause:** Poor sleep quality (cycles disrupted)

**Which one resonated?** Reply with 1, 2, or 3. I'll send you the most relevant tip for your type.

(Seriously — the fix for Type 1 is completely different from Type 3. Generic advice wastes your time.)

## EMAIL 16 (Day 16)

**Subject:** Your sleep is costing you $X per year
**Preview:** The math nobody does

---

{{first_name}},

Let's do some uncomfortable math.

Poor sleep costs the average American worker **11 days of productivity per year.** (Harvard Medical School study.)

At the median US salary, that's roughly **$2,280 per year** in lost productivity.

But that's just the work impact. Add in:

- **Healthcare costs** from sleep-related conditions: ~$1,200/year more than good sleepers
- **Impulse spending** from fatigue-impaired decision making: researchers estimate 20% more discretionary spending when sleep-deprived
- **Caffeine and energy drink habit:** $500-1,500/year for daily consumers

Conservatively, poor sleep costs you **$4,000-6,000 per year.**

Now flip it: what's the ROI of fixing your sleep?

If a $17 protocol, a $67 course, or even a $197 program saves you $4,000+ per year in productivity, healthcare, and wasted spending... that's a 20-200x return.

I don't say this to sell you something. I say this because most people treat sleep as optional — a luxury they'll "get to eventually."

But sleep is the highest-leverage investment you can make in your performance, health, and quality of life. The research is overwhelming and unambiguous.

Whatever approach you take — free tips, the protocol, a course, or just reading articles on SleepSmarter.io — please take your sleep seriously. The math doesn't lie.

Tomorrow: a myth about melatonin that your doctor probably believes.

## EMAIL 17 (Day 17)

**Subject:** What nobody tells you about melatonin
**Preview:** You're probably taking 10x too much

---

{{first_name}},

Melatonin is the most popular sleep supplement in America. It's also the most misunderstood.

Here's what most people get wrong:

**Myth: "Melatonin is a sleeping pill."**
**Truth:** Melatonin is a *timing signal*, not a sedative. It tells your brain "it's nighttime." It doesn't knock you out.

**Myth: "More is better."**
**Truth:** Most melatonin supplements are 3-10mg. The physiologically effective dose is **0.3-0.5mg.** Ten to thirty times less than what's in the bottle.

Higher doses can actually cause:
- Grogginess the next morning
- Vivid, disturbing dreams
- Headaches
- Your body reducing its own melatonin production

**Myth: "Take it right before bed."**
**Truth:** Take it **60-90 minutes before** your target bedtime. It needs time to build up and signal your circadian system.

**When melatonin actually helps:**
✅ Jet lag (resetting your clock to a new timezone)
✅ Shift work (forcing a new sleep window)
✅ Delayed sleep phase (you're a night owl trying to sleep earlier)

**When it doesn't help:**
❌ General insomnia (the problem isn't timing, it's arousal)
❌ Waking up during the night (melatonin doesn't maintain sleep)
❌ Feeling unrested (that's a sleep quality issue)

**My recommendation:** If you use melatonin, find a **0.3mg or 0.5mg dose** (they exist but you have to look). Take it 90 minutes before bed. Use it for 2 weeks maximum, then stop.

For most people, fixing their light exposure, caffeine timing, and bedroom temperature eliminates the need for any supplement.

I'll be back in a couple days with something I've been working on. It's for people who want to go deeper than tips and articles — a complete system for transforming your sleep. More soon.
