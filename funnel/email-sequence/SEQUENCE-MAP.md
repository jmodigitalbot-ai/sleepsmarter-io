## Behavioral Triggers (Frank Kern Style)

### If subscriber clicks tripwire link but doesn't buy:
→ Send 2 follow-up emails with different angles (objection handling)

### If subscriber buys tripwire:
→ Skip remaining tripwire emails
→ Accelerate to core offer (Day 14 instead of Day 18)
→ Tag: `tripwire-buyer`

### If subscriber buys core offer:
→ Skip remaining core emails
→ Move to premium offer
→ Tag: `masterclass-buyer`

### If subscriber opens but never clicks:
→ Send re-engagement email at Day 15 with subject: "Should I stop emailing you?"

### If subscriber goes inactive (no opens for 7 days):
→ Send "break up" email: "I noticed you haven't been opening my emails..."

## Key Principles

1. **Every email tells a story** — No corporate newsletter vibes
2. **Open loops** — End emails with curiosity hooks for the next day
3. **Reply requests** — Ask for replies to boost deliverability
4. **One CTA per email** — Don't overwhelm
5. **Value first, pitch second** — 70% value, 30% pitch across the sequence
6. **Sarah's voice** — Warm, knowledgeable, slightly informal, evidence-based
