### Email 0 — Day 0
**Subject:** Your Sleep Blueprint is ready, {{first_name}}
**Preview:** Plus one thing to try tonight
**Delay after previous:** Immediate

Hi {{first_name}},

I just looked at your sleep calculator results, and I want to be honest with you — most people in your situation are losing 1-2 hours of quality sleep every single night without realizing it.

The good news? It's fixable. And it usually takes less than a week.

I put together your Personalized Sleep Blueprint based on the data you shared. Inside you'll find:

✅ Your ideal sleep schedule (based on YOUR wake time)
✅ The 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol preview
✅ 5 things you can do TONIGHT to sleep better
✅ My top product recommendations for deeper sleep

**[Download Your Sleep Blueprint →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blueprint)** *(Note: link to PDF delivery page once built)*

Quick tip: Start with the "5 Quick Wins" on page 5 tonight. Especially #3 — the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Most people notice a difference within 48 hours.

Tomorrow, I'm going to share something about sleep that most doctors never mention. It completely changed how I think about rest — and it'll probably change how you think about your alarm clock.

Sleep well,
Dr. Sarah Chen

P.S. If you have a specific sleep question, just hit reply. I read every email.

### Email 1 — Day 1
**Subject:** The 90-minute secret nobody talks about
**Preview:** Why 6 hours can feel better than 8
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Here's something that blew my mind when I first learned it:

**Sleeping 6 hours can make you feel MORE rested than sleeping 8 hours.**

How is that possible?

It comes down to one number: **90**.

Every night, your brain cycles through 4 stages of sleep. Light sleep → deep sleep → deeper sleep → REM (dreaming). One complete cycle takes roughly 90 minutes.

Here's where it gets interesting:

If your alarm goes off in the MIDDLE of a deep sleep cycle — which is what happens when you sleep random amounts — you wake up feeling like you got hit by a bus. Groggy. Foggy. Reaching for caffeine.

But if you wake up at the END of a cycle — even after fewer total hours — you feel refreshed. Clear. Actually *awake*.

This is why:
- 7.5 hours (5 cycles) → wake up refreshed ✅
- 8 hours (5.3 cycles) → wake up groggy ❌
- 6 hours (4 cycles) → wake up decent ✅
- 7 hours (4.6 cycles) → wake up terrible ❌

**The sleep calculator on SleepSmarter.io does this math for you automatically.** It calculates your ideal bedtime based on complete cycles.

I wrote a deep dive on how this works: [Read: How Sleep Cycles Work →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/how-sleep-cycles-work)

Tomorrow, I want to tell you about the night I accidentally discovered this myself. I'd been sleeping "8 hours" for years and wondering why I was always exhausted...

### Email 2 — Day 2
**Subject:** I slept 6 hours and felt better than 8
**Preview:** The night everything changed
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Last year, I had a flight that left at 5:45 AM.

I'd been at a conference all day, got back to my hotel around midnight, and set my alarm for 4:00 AM. Four hours of sleep. I was dreading the next day.

But something strange happened.

I woke up before my alarm. At 3:58 AM. And I felt... fine? Actually, I felt *good*. Clear-headed. No grogginess.

I'd accidentally aligned with my sleep cycles. Midnight to 4 AM = exactly 4 cycles × 60 minutes... wait, no. 4 × 90 = 360 minutes = 6 hours. I must have fallen asleep around 10 PM without realizing it.

The point isn't that 6 hours is ideal — it's not. But **cycle alignment matters more than total hours.**

I started experimenting. Instead of setting my alarm for "8 hours after I go to bed," I calculated my bedtime based on complete 90-minute cycles from my target wake time.

The first week was revelatory. I was sleeping 7.5 hours instead of 8, but waking up naturally before my alarm. No more snooze button. No more 20-minute fog.

**Here's your assignment for tonight:**

1. Decide what time you need to wake up tomorrow
2. Count backwards in 90-minute blocks
3. Add 15 minutes (time to fall asleep)
4. That's your bedtime. Set an alarm for it.

I wrote more about this here: [Read: How Sleep Cycles Work →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/how-sleep-cycles-work)

Let me know how it goes — seriously, hit reply and tell me. I love hearing these stories.

Tomorrow: the single most impactful thing in your bedroom that's probably ruining your sleep. (It's not your mattress.)

Sarah

### Email 3 — Day 3
**Subject:** The one thing in your bedroom ruining your sleep
**Preview:** It's not your mattress (it's probably on your nightstand)
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Pop quiz: what's the #1 sleep disruptor in most bedrooms?

Not an old mattress.
Not a snoring partner.
Not street noise.

**It's temperature.**

Your body needs to drop 2-3°F in core temperature to initiate sleep. If your room is too warm, your brain literally can't start the process. You lie there, tossing and turning, wondering why you can't fall asleep — and it's because your body is stuck in "daytime mode."

The research is clear: **the ideal sleep temperature is 65-68°F (18-20°C).**

Most people keep their bedrooms at 72°F or higher. That's 5-7 degrees too warm for optimal sleep.

Here's what to do tonight:

**Drop your thermostat to 67°F before bed.** Yes, it'll feel cold when you first get in. That's the point. Your body will cool down faster, and you'll fall asleep faster.

Can't control the thermostat? Three alternatives:
1. **Stick one foot out from under the covers** — your feet act as radiators, releasing heat
2. **Take a warm shower 90 minutes before bed** — counterintuitive, but the rapid cooling afterward triggers sleepiness
3. **Use a lighter blanket** — swap the thick comforter for a breathable option

I actually wrote a detailed guide on optimizing your sleep environment. If you want to go deeper: [Read: Why Do I Wake Up Tired? →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/why-do-i-wake-up-tired)

Tomorrow, we're going to talk about why "trying harder" to sleep is the worst thing you can do — and what to do instead.

Sarah

P.S. If the temperature tip alone improves your sleep tonight, reply and let me know. These quick wins add up fast.

### Email 4 — Day 4
**Subject:** Why willpower won't fix your sleep
**Preview:** Systems beat motivation every time
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

You know what never works for sleep?

"I'm going to try really hard to go to bed earlier."

It's like saying "I'm going to try really hard to fall asleep." The harder you try, the worse it gets. Sleep doesn't respond to willpower. It responds to **systems**.

Here's what I mean:

**Willpower approach:** "I should stop looking at my phone in bed."
**Systems approach:** Phone charges in the kitchen. Not in the bedroom. Not on the nightstand. Not even in the room.

**Willpower approach:** "I'll try to go to bed by 10:30."
**Systems approach:** A "bedtime alarm" goes off at 10:00. When it rings, I start my 30-minute wind-down routine. Same routine. Every night.

**Willpower approach:** "I'll cut back on caffeine."
**Systems approach:** No coffee after 2 PM. The afternoon coffee is replaced with herbal tea. The tea is already in the cabinet. The decision is already made.

See the difference? Systems remove the decision. And decisions are where willpower fails.

**The 10-3-2-1-0 Rule is the best sleep system I've ever found:**

- **10 hours before bed:** No more caffeine
- **3 hours before bed:** No more food or alcohol
- **2 hours before bed:** No more work
- **1 hour before bed:** No more screens
- **0:** The number of times you hit snooze

I wrote a complete breakdown of how to implement this: [The 10-3-2-1-0 Sleep Rule Explained →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/10-3-2-1-0-sleep-rule)

It takes about a week to make it automatic. After that, you don't need willpower. The system runs itself.

Tomorrow, I have a quick question for you. It'll take 10 seconds to answer and it'll help me send you the most relevant tips going forward.

### Email 5 — Day 5
**Subject:** {{first_name}}, quick question about your sleep
**Preview:** 10-second answer, I promise
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

I've been sending you sleep tips for a few days now, and I want to make sure I'm helping with what YOU actually need.

Quick question — just hit reply with the number:

**What's your biggest sleep struggle right now?**

1. I can't fall asleep (takes forever to drift off)
2. I wake up in the middle of the night
3. I wake up too early and can't go back to sleep
4. I sleep enough hours but still feel tired
5. My schedule is all over the place (shift work, travel, etc.)

Just reply with the number. That's it.

I ask because I'm working on something specifically designed to help with the most common sleep problems. Knowing what you're dealing with helps me tailor what I send you.

(And yes, I really do read every reply. You'd be surprised how many people write back with detailed stories about their sleep. I love it.)

Talk soon,
Sarah

P.S. Speaking of what I'm working on — I'll share more about it in a couple days. It's a complete protocol I've been developing, and the results from beta testers have been... well, I'll let them tell you themselves.

### Email 6 — Day 6
**Subject:** The protocol that changed everything for me
**Preview:** I used to think I was just "not a morning person"
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Can I tell you something personal?

For most of my twenties, I was a mess.

I'd drag myself out of bed every morning, slam two cups of coffee before 9 AM, crash around 2 PM, drink more coffee, lie awake until midnight, and repeat. I thought I was just "not a morning person." That it was genetic. Permanent.

I was a sleep researcher who couldn't sleep. The irony wasn't lost on me.

Then I hit a wall. I made a mistake at work — a big one — because I was running on 4 hours of fragmented sleep. That was my wake-up call (no pun intended).

I spent the next three months testing every sleep technique I could find. Most were garbage. Some helped a little. But when I combined the ones that worked into a specific 7-day sequence... everything changed.

By day 3, I was falling asleep in under 15 minutes.
By day 5, I was waking up before my alarm.
By day 7, I felt like a different person.

I started sharing it with colleagues. Then patients. Then friends of friends. The results were consistent — not perfect for everyone, but consistently better.

I eventually formalized it into what I now call the **7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol.**

You got a preview of it in your Sleep Blueprint. But the preview is just the roadmap. The full protocol is the GPS — turn-by-turn directions, what to do when you get lost, and troubleshooting for every common problem.

I'll tell you more about it tomorrow. But first — did you try any of the tips from the Blueprint? I'd genuinely love to hear.

Hit reply and let me know.

### Email 7 — Day 7
**Subject:** Day 1 of the protocol (try this tonight)
**Preview:** The most important 60 seconds of your day
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

I'm going to give you Day 1 of the Sleep Reset Protocol for free. Right here. Right now.

**Day 1: Anchor Your Wake Time**

Here's what you do:

1. Pick your wake time. Not your ideal wake time. Your REAL wake time — the time you actually need to be up for your life to work.

2. Set ONE alarm. Not three. Not five with 9-minute snooze intervals. One.

3. When it goes off, do this within 60 seconds:
   - Feet on the floor
   - Lights on (or curtains open)
   - 10 seconds of deep breathing

That's it. That's Day 1.

"Sarah, that seems too simple."

It is simple. It's also the foundation that everything else builds on. Here's why:

Your circadian rhythm — your internal 24-hour clock — is anchored by ONE signal more than any other: **when you wake up.** Not when you go to bed. When you WAKE UP.

Every time you hit snooze, sleep in on weekends, or vary your wake time by more than 30 minutes, you're telling your brain "I don't know when morning is." And a confused brain can't prepare for sleep at the right time.

Consistent wake time → consistent sleepiness at bedtime → faster sleep onset → complete sleep cycles → refreshed mornings.

**It starts with Day 1. Try it tomorrow morning.**

Now, Days 2-7 build on this foundation with specific protocols for light exposure, caffeine timing, environment optimization, wind-down routines, and weekend consistency. Each day has:

- Exact instructions (what to do and when)
- The science behind it (so you understand WHY)
- Troubleshooting tips (for when it doesn't go perfectly)
- A tracking checklist (so you can measure progress)

The complete protocol is $17 and it's changed the sleep of thousands of people.

**[Get the 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol → $17](TRIPWIRE_LINK_TBD)**

Or don't. Day 1 alone will help. But if you want the full system — the one that compounds day over day — it's there when you're ready.

### Email 8 — Day 8
**Subject:** "I can't believe the difference" — Maria K.
**Preview:** She was skeptical too
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

I got this email last month and it made my day:

> *"Sarah, I've been a terrible sleeper for 15 years. I've tried melatonin, meditation apps, weighted blankets, CBD — you name it. Nothing stuck for more than a week.*
>
> *I almost didn't buy the protocol because $17 seemed too cheap to actually work. (I've spent hundreds on supplements that did nothing.)*
>
> *But by Day 4, I was falling asleep in 10 minutes. TEN MINUTES. I used to lie awake for an hour minimum. By Day 7, my husband noticed the difference before I told him about it. He said I seemed 'lighter.'*
>
> *I can't believe the difference. I wish I'd found this years ago."*
>
> — Maria K., Phoenix, AZ

Maria's story isn't unusual. But I want to be transparent about something:

**The protocol doesn't work for everyone.**

It works best for people who:
✅ Have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
✅ Wake up feeling tired despite "enough" hours
✅ Have inconsistent sleep schedules
✅ Are willing to follow 7 days of instructions

It's NOT a substitute for medical treatment if you have:
❌ Diagnosed sleep apnea
❌ Chronic insomnia requiring medication
❌ A medical condition affecting sleep

For the vast majority of people who "just don't sleep well," it works. And it works fast.

### Email 10 — Day 10
**Subject:** Last call + a bonus I haven't mentioned
**Preview:** Closing this out today
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Last email about the Sleep Reset Protocol. I promise.

Before I move on, I want to add one thing I haven't mentioned:

**BONUS: The "Can't Sleep" Audio Guide**

I recorded a 12-minute guided relaxation specifically designed for when you're lying in bed and can't fall asleep. It uses a technique called cognitive shuffling — basically, it gives your brain random, boring images to process, which prevents the anxious thought loops that keep you awake.

I've had people tell me this single audio is worth more than the rest of the protocol combined.

It's included free with the 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol.

**[Get Instant Access → $17](TRIPWIRE_LINK_TBD)**

Here's what you're getting for $17:
- ✅ Complete 7-day protocol with daily instructions
- ✅ Sleep tracking templates
- ✅ Supplement timing guide
- ✅ Environment optimization checklist
- ✅ Emergency Sleep Protocol
- ✅ **NEW: "Can't Sleep" Audio Guide**
- ✅ 60-day money-back guarantee

After today, I'll go back to sending you free sleep tips and articles. No more pitches for a while. But if you've been on the fence, this is the moment.

**[Yes, I want better sleep → $17](TRIPWIRE_LINK_TBD)**

Either way, I'll talk to you tomorrow with something completely different — a myth about caffeine that will probably surprise you.

### Email 11 — Day 11
**Subject:** What your sleep score really means
**Preview:** Most people misread this number
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Sleep trackers are everywhere now. Oura rings, Apple Watches, Fitbits — they all give you a "sleep score."

But most people have no idea what that number actually means. Or worse, they stress about it, which — ironically — makes their sleep worse.

Here's what actually matters:

**Sleep Efficiency** = Time asleep ÷ Time in bed × 100

- **Above 85%:** You're doing great
- **75-85%:** Room for improvement
- **Below 75%:** Something needs attention

If you're spending 9 hours in bed but only sleeping 7, your efficiency is 78%. The fix isn't sleeping more — it's spending LESS time in bed. (I know that sounds backwards.)

This is called "sleep restriction therapy," and it's one of the most counterintuitive but effective techniques in sleep medicine.

**The other number that matters: Sleep Latency**

This is how long it takes you to fall asleep.

- **Under 15 minutes:** Ideal
- **15-30 minutes:** Normal
- **Over 30 minutes:** Indicates a problem
- **Under 5 minutes:** You're sleep deprived (your body is crashing, not falling asleep)

If your sleep latency is consistently over 30 minutes, the issue is almost always one of three things: timing (wrong bedtime), environment (too warm, too bright), or arousal (anxious/racing thoughts).

I cover all three in depth here: [Why Do I Wake Up Tired? →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/why-do-i-wake-up-tired)

Talk tomorrow,
Sarah

### Email 12 — Day 12
**Subject:** The caffeine lie (it's worse than you think)
**Preview:** Your 2 PM coffee is still in your system at midnight
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

How long do you think caffeine stays in your system?

Most people guess 4-5 hours. That's the "half-life" you see on Google.

But half-life means half the caffeine is STILL in your body after 5 hours. And it takes **5 half-lives** to fully clear.

Here's what that actually looks like:

**You drink a coffee at 2:00 PM (200mg caffeine):**
- 7:00 PM → 100mg still active
- 12:00 AM → 50mg still active
- 5:00 AM → 25mg still active

At midnight, you still have the equivalent of half a cup of coffee coursing through your system. And you're wondering why you can't fall asleep.

**It gets worse:** As you age, caffeine metabolism slows. A 25-year-old clears caffeine ~40% faster than a 50-year-old. Same cup of coffee, very different impact.

**My rule:** No caffeine after noon. Not 2 PM. Not 1 PM. Noon.

"But Sarah, I NEED my afternoon coffee."

I hear you. Here's what I recommend instead:

1. **Afternoon slump?** Take a 20-minute nap (set an alarm). More effective than caffeine and no sleep disruption.
2. **Need the ritual?** Switch to decaf after noon. Your brain associates the taste with alertness — you'll get a mild placebo effect.
3. **Need actual energy?** 10 minutes of sunlight + a 5-minute walk. Resets your circadian rhythm and gives you 1-2 hours of natural alertness.

I wrote a complete guide to the timing rules that protect your sleep: [The 10-3-2-1-0 Rule →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/10-3-2-1-0-sleep-rule)

### Email 13 — Day 13
**Subject:** Your sleep is different (and that's okay)
**Preview:** One-size-fits-all sleep advice is mostly wrong
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

One thing that drives me crazy about sleep advice: everyone acts like there's ONE right answer.

"Go to bed at 10 PM."
"Get 8 hours."
"Wake up at 6 AM."

This ignores the fact that **people are fundamentally different sleepers.**

Your chronotype — your genetic sleep preference — determines whether you're naturally a morning person, a night owl, or somewhere in between. Fighting your chronotype is like swimming upstream. You can do it, but it's exhausting and mostly pointless.

**The 4 chronotypes:**

🦁 **Lion (Early bird)** — Naturally wakes at 5-6 AM. Peak energy before noon. Crashes by 9 PM. (~15% of people)

🐻 **Bear (Most common)** — Follows the solar cycle. Best energy mid-morning. Ideal bedtime 10-11 PM. (~50% of people)

🐺 **Wolf (Night owl)** — Doesn't really wake up until 9-10 AM. Peak creativity at night. Best bedtime after midnight. (~15% of people)

🐬 **Dolphin (Light sleeper)** — Irregular patterns. Often struggles with insomnia. Needs the most sleep hygiene structure. (~10% of people)

**You can't turn a Wolf into a Lion.** But you CAN optimize a Wolf's schedule so they get incredible sleep within THEIR natural window.

This is why generic sleep advice fails. And why the Sleep Blueprint and the articles on SleepSmarter.io are built around YOUR schedule, not some arbitrary "ideal."

I go deeper on this in our guide: [How Much Sleep Do I Need? →](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/how-much-sleep-do-i-need)

Tomorrow: a number that will make you rethink how you value sleep.

### Email 14 — Day 14
**Subject:** How I helped 1,000 people sleep better
**Preview:** The patterns I keep seeing
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

After working with over a thousand people on their sleep, I've noticed something:

The people who fix their sleep the fastest all do the same three things:

**1. They commit to 7 days minimum**
Not 2 days. Not "I'll try tonight and see." Seven days. Sleep is a system, and systems need time to calibrate. The people who quit after 2 days because "it didn't work yet" never give their body a chance to adjust.

**2. They change their environment, not just their behavior**
Willpower is finite. Environment is permanent. The people who put their phone in another room sleep better than the people who "try not to check it." The people who buy blackout curtains sleep better than the people who "try to ignore the light."

**3. They track their progress**
Not obsessively. But a simple sleep log — bedtime, wake time, how they feel — creates awareness. And awareness creates change. You can't improve what you don't measure.

These three principles are the backbone of everything I teach. They're baked into the Sleep Reset Protocol, and they'll be the foundation of something bigger I'm building right now.

More on that next week. For now — are you tracking your sleep? Even a simple note on your phone each morning makes a difference.

### Email 15 — Day 15
**Subject:** The 3 sleep types (which one are you?)
**Preview:** Your answer changes everything
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

After analyzing patterns from thousands of sleepers, I've identified 3 distinct "sleep problem types." Most people fall clearly into one category:

**Type 1: The Wired Mind 🧠**
- Takes 30+ minutes to fall asleep
- Racing thoughts at bedtime
- Replays the day or worries about tomorrow
- Often checks phone "one more time"
- **Root cause:** Hyperarousal — brain won't downshift

**Type 2: The Broken Clock ⏰**
- Falls asleep fine but wakes at 2-3 AM
- Can't get back to sleep for 30-60 minutes
- OR wakes up way too early
- Tired but "wired" during the night
- **Root cause:** Circadian rhythm disruption

**Type 3: The Zombie 🧟**
- Sleeps 7-8 hours but wakes up exhausted
- Needs multiple alarms
- Heavy caffeine dependence
- Feels foggy until noon
- **Root cause:** Poor sleep quality (cycles disrupted)

**Which one resonated?** Reply with 1, 2, or 3. I'll send you the most relevant tip for your type.

(Seriously — the fix for Type 1 is completely different from Type 3. Generic advice wastes your time.)

### Email 16 — Day 16
**Subject:** Your sleep is costing you $X per year
**Preview:** The math nobody does
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Let's do some uncomfortable math.

Poor sleep costs the average American worker **11 days of productivity per year.** (Harvard Medical School study.)

At the median US salary, that's roughly **$2,280 per year** in lost productivity.

But that's just the work impact. Add in:

- **Healthcare costs** from sleep-related conditions: ~$1,200/year more than good sleepers
- **Impulse spending** from fatigue-impaired decision making: researchers estimate 20% more discretionary spending when sleep-deprived
- **Caffeine and energy drink habit:** $500-1,500/year for daily consumers

Conservatively, poor sleep costs you **$4,000-6,000 per year.**

Now flip it: what's the ROI of fixing your sleep?

If a $17 protocol, a $67 course, or even a $197 program saves you $4,000+ per year in productivity, healthcare, and wasted spending... that's a 20-200x return.

I don't say this to sell you something. I say this because most people treat sleep as optional — a luxury they'll "get to eventually."

But sleep is the highest-leverage investment you can make in your performance, health, and quality of life. The research is overwhelming and unambiguous.

Whatever approach you take — free tips, the protocol, a course, or just reading articles on SleepSmarter.io — please take your sleep seriously. The math doesn't lie.

Tomorrow: a myth about melatonin that your doctor probably believes.

### Email 17 — Day 17
**Subject:** What nobody tells you about melatonin
**Preview:** You're probably taking 10x too much
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Melatonin is the most popular sleep supplement in America. It's also the most misunderstood.

Here's what most people get wrong:

**Myth: "Melatonin is a sleeping pill."**
**Truth:** Melatonin is a *timing signal*, not a sedative. It tells your brain "it's nighttime." It doesn't knock you out.

**Myth: "More is better."**
**Truth:** Most melatonin supplements are 3-10mg. The physiologically effective dose is **0.3-0.5mg.** Ten to thirty times less than what's in the bottle.

Higher doses can actually cause:
- Grogginess the next morning
- Vivid, disturbing dreams
- Headaches
- Your body reducing its own melatonin production

**Myth: "Take it right before bed."**
**Truth:** Take it **60-90 minutes before** your target bedtime. It needs time to build up and signal your circadian system.

**When melatonin actually helps:**
✅ Jet lag (resetting your clock to a new timezone)
✅ Shift work (forcing a new sleep window)
✅ Delayed sleep phase (you're a night owl trying to sleep earlier)

**When it doesn't help:**
❌ General insomnia (the problem isn't timing, it's arousal)
❌ Waking up during the night (melatonin doesn't maintain sleep)
❌ Feeling unrested (that's a sleep quality issue)

**My recommendation:** If you use melatonin, find a **0.3mg or 0.5mg dose** (they exist but you have to look). Take it 90 minutes before bed. Use it for 2 weeks maximum, then stop.

For most people, fixing their light exposure, caffeine timing, and bedroom temperature eliminates the need for any supplement.

I'll be back in a couple days with something I've been working on. It's for people who want to go deeper than tips and articles — a complete system for transforming your sleep. More soon.

### Email 18 — Day 18
**Subject:** I built something for people like you
**Preview:** It's been months in the making
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Remember when I mentioned I was working on something bigger?

It's ready.

For the past several months, I've been taking everything I know about sleep — the research, the protocols, the techniques that actually work — and organizing it into a comprehensive system.

Not a PDF. Not a blog post. A complete, structured program that takes you from wherever you are now to consistently great sleep.

I'm calling it the **Sleep Smarter Masterclass.**

Here's why I built it:

The Sleep Blueprint is a great starting point. The 7-Day Protocol works for quick fixes. But some people need — and want — the full picture. The deep science. The advanced techniques. The troubleshooting for every edge case.

The emails and articles I send are helpful, but they're scattered. A tip here, a technique there. The Masterclass puts it all in order — a clear path from A to Z.

I'll share the full details tomorrow. But I wanted you to hear about it first, before anyone else. You've been reading my emails and engaging with this content. This was built for people exactly like you.

Talk soon,
Sarah

### Email 20 — Day 20
**Subject:** "I wish I found this sooner" — David R.
**Preview:** From 5-hour sleeper to 7.5 hours of quality rest
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

David is a 42-year-old project manager with two kids. Here's what he told me:

> *"I'd basically accepted that bad sleep was just part of being a working dad. Everyone around me complained about being tired, so I figured it was normal.*
>
> *I went through the Masterclass on a Sunday afternoon. Module 2 was the game-changer — I realized I'd been fighting my chronotype my entire adult life. I'm a Wolf trying to live a Lion's schedule.*
>
> *Just shifting my bedtime 45 minutes later (counterintuitive, I know) and adjusting my morning routine made a massive difference. I'm actually sleeping 7.5 quality hours now instead of 'trying to get 8' and ending up with 5 hours of tossing.*
>
> *I wish I'd found this sooner. Years of exhaustion because I was following generic advice that didn't fit my biology."*
>
> — David R., Chicago

David's experience highlights something important: **the answer isn't always "more sleep."** Sometimes it's better-timed sleep. Sometimes it's less time in bed but higher quality. Sometimes it's one specific change that unlocks everything else.

The Masterclass helps you find YOUR specific change. Not generic advice. Not what works for "most people." What works for you.

**[Find your specific change → $67](MASTERCLASS_LINK_TBD)**

60-day guarantee. If David's story doesn't become your story, you get your money back.

**Subject:** What's really included (the full breakdown)
**Preview:** I want you to know exactly what you're getting
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

I realize I've talked a lot about what the Masterclass teaches, but I haven't been clear about what you physically GET. Let me fix that:

**When you enroll today, you get:**

📚 **6 Core Modules** — Structured curriculum you can go through at your own pace. Each module is focused and actionable — no filler, no fluff, no 45-minute videos of someone talking at a whiteboard.

### Email 22 — Day 22
**Subject:** Closing the launch price tomorrow
**Preview:** $67 won't last forever
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Quick note: I've been offering the Sleep Smarter Masterclass at the introductory price of $67. That price is going up to $97 soon.

I'm not doing the fake countdown timer thing. I genuinely underpriced this to get early feedback and testimonials. As the program grows and I add more content, the price will reflect that.

If you've been thinking about it, now is the time.

**What you're getting for $67:**
- ✅ 6 comprehensive modules
- ✅ Action sheets for every module
- ✅ Sleep tracking system
- ✅ Complete supplement guide
- ✅ Product recommendation guide (with affiliate links to best prices)
- ✅ Lifetime updates
- ✅ Direct email access to me
- ✅ 60-day money-back guarantee

**What people typically spend on sleep "solutions" that don't work:**
- Melatonin supplements: $15-30/month ($180-360/year)
- Sleep apps: $50-70/year
- Weighted blankets: $100-200
- Random mattress upgrade: $800-2,000

**Total: $1,000+ on band-aids.**

Or $67 on a system that fixes the root cause.

**[Lock in the $67 price → Enroll now](MASTERCLASS_LINK_TBD)**

After this, I'll shift to talking about something for people who want even more personalized support. But this is the last time I'll pitch the Masterclass for a while.

Your call, {{first_name}}. Either way, I'll keep showing up in your inbox with value.

### Email 23 — Day 23
**Subject:** For those who want the full transformation
**Preview:** This isn't for everyone (and that's okay)
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

I need to be upfront: today's email is for a specific type of person.

If you're happy with the free tips and articles — great. Keep reading them. They work. You don't need to spend a dime.

If you got the 7-Day Protocol or the Masterclass — amazing. Those are complete systems that will serve you well.

But some people want more. They want:

- A personalized plan built for THEIR life, THEIR schedule, THEIR problems
- Ongoing support, not just a one-time program
- Someone checking in on their progress
- Advanced optimization beyond "the basics"

If that's you, I created the **90-Day Sleep Transformation Program.**

It's the most comprehensive thing I offer, and it's designed for people who are done with "good enough" sleep and want *exceptional* sleep.

I'll share exactly what's included tomorrow. Today I just want to plant the seed:

**If you could have genuinely great sleep — not "okay" sleep, not "better than before" sleep, but wake-up-excited, clear-headed, energized-all-day sleep — every single day for the rest of your life...**

What would that be worth to you?

Hold that number in your mind. I think you'll find tomorrow's email interesting.

### Email 24 — Day 24
**Subject:** 90 days to a completely different life
**Preview:** The full transformation package
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

Here's what's inside the 90-Day Sleep Transformation Program:

**Everything in the Masterclass, plus:**

🎯 **Personalized Sleep Plan**
Based on a detailed intake assessment, I create a customized 90-day plan for your specific situation. Your chronotype, your work schedule, your health conditions, your goals — all factored in. This isn't generic. It's YOURS.

📧 **Weekly Optimization Emails**
Every week for 90 days, you get a targeted email with your focus for that week. Week 1 might be circadian rhythm. Week 5 might be stress management. Week 10 might be performance optimization. Each builds on the last.

📊 **Monthly Progress Reviews**
At day 30, 60, and 90, we review your sleep data and adjust the plan. What's working stays. What isn't gets modified. This iterative approach is why the results compound.

👥 **Private Community Access**
Connect with other people going through the program. Share wins, ask questions, get support. Having a community of people on the same journey makes a measurable difference in follow-through.

📚 **Advanced Content Library**
Topics beyond the Masterclass: sleep and hormones, sleep and athletic performance, sleep and aging, sleep and creativity, advanced supplement protocols, biohacking techniques.

**Price: $197** (one-time, 90-day program + lifetime community access)
**Guarantee: 60 days.** Full refund if you don't see measurable improvement.

**[Start Your 90-Day Transformation → $197](PREMIUM_LINK_TBD)**

This program has a cap. I limit enrollment because the personalized plans require my attention. When spots fill, I close registration until the next cohort.

### Email 25 — Day 25
**Subject:** Something new (and different)
**Preview:** A monthly thing I'm testing
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

I've been thinking about what happens AFTER someone fixes their sleep.

The Masterclass teaches you the system. The 90-Day Program transforms your habits. But sleep isn't a "fix it and forget it" thing. Seasons change. Life changes. Stress levels fluctuate. New research comes out.

So I'm testing something: **The Sleep Smarter Insider.**

It's a monthly membership ($19/month) that keeps you optimized long-term:

**What you get each month:**

🔬 **Research Roundup** — I read the sleep journals so you don't have to. I'll distill the latest findings into actionable takeaways.

🛒 **Product Review** — One honest, in-depth review of a sleep product. No sponsorships. Just my genuine opinion after testing.

📅 **Seasonal Sleep Guide** — Your sleep needs change with the seasons. Daylight saving time, summer heat, holiday stress, winter darkness — I'll send a guide for each transition.

💡 **Monthly Optimization Challenge** — One specific thing to try or change each month. Small, focused improvements that compound over time.

👥 **Community Access** — Same community as the Transformation program. Ongoing support and connection.

**Price: $19/month** (cancel anytime, no commitment)

I'm launching this quietly to my email list first. If it resonates, I'll open it up publicly later.

**[Join the Sleep Smarter Insider → $19/mo](MEMBERSHIP_LINK_TBD)**

No pressure on this one. It's for people who've already improved their sleep and want to maintain and optimize it over time. If that's not where you are yet, focus on the fundamentals first.

### Email 26 — Day 26
**Subject:** Your monthly sleep optimization plan
**Preview:** Here's a sample of what members get
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

To give you a taste of what Insider members get, here's a sample optimization focus:

**Sample Focus: Light Exposure Optimization**

Most people get dramatically less natural light than their circadian rhythm needs — especially during shorter days or if you work indoors. This is a hidden cause of:
- Difficulty waking up in the morning
- Low energy throughout the day
- Earlier onset of sleepiness (but not better sleep)
- Mild mood changes

**The fix is simple but specific:**

1. Get outside within 30 minutes of waking (even 10 minutes helps)
2. If sunrise is after your wake time, use a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp for 20-30 minutes at breakfast
3. Reduce indoor blue light after sunset (warmer bulbs, screen filters)
4. Optimize your bedroom darkness (blackout curtains are non-negotiable)

Insider members get the full guide with product recommendations, timing protocols for different chronotypes, and troubleshooting.

### Email 27 — Day 27
**Subject:** What I've learned from 10,000 sleepers
**Preview:** 5 things that surprised me
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

After working with thousands of people on their sleep, here are 5 things that still surprise me:

**1. The people who sleep "fine" often benefit the most.**
They don't think they have a problem. They sleep 7 hours, function okay, and assume that's their ceiling. Then they optimize their timing and environment and realize they were operating at 60% when they could be at 90%.

**2. Supplements are almost never the answer.**
I'd estimate that 90% of sleep problems are behavioral or environmental. Supplements should be the last thing you try, not the first. Yet most people start there because it's the easiest change.

**3. Consistency beats everything.**
The single most impactful change anyone can make: same wake time, every day, including weekends. It's boring advice. It's also the closest thing to a sleep miracle that exists.

**4. Cold bedrooms are non-negotiable.**
I've never seen someone switch to 65-67°F and NOT see improvement. It's the closest thing to a universal fix I've found.

**5. People underestimate the compounding effect.**
Week 1 improvements are modest. Week 4 improvements are noticeable. Week 12 improvements are transformational. Sleep optimization compounds like interest. The people who stick with it for 90+ days see results they never expected.

That last point is why I built the 90-Day Transformation Program. Quick fixes are great. But real transformation takes time — and support.

Whatever path you're on — free tips, the Protocol, the Masterclass, or the full program — keep going. It compounds.

### Email 28 — Day 28
**Subject:** The products that actually work (my honest list)
**Preview:** No sponsorships. Just what I'd buy with my own money.
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

People ask me for product recommendations all the time. Here's my honest, unsponsored list — what I'd buy with my own money:

**🛏️ Pillowcase: Silk**
A mulberry silk pillowcase ($30-60) reduces friction, stays cool, and protects your skin and hair. Small upgrade, noticeable difference. → [Our full review](https://www.sleepsmarter.io/blog/best-silk-pillowcases-for-sleep)

**🔊 Sound: White Noise Machine**
Consistent background sound masks disruptions. I prefer dedicated machines over apps (phone should be out of the bedroom). → Our top picks *(article coming soon)*

**🌡️ Temperature: Cooling Mattress Pad**
If you sleep hot and can't control room temperature, a cooling pad is the best investment. $150-300 but lasts for years.

**💊 Supplement: Magnesium Glycinate**
The one supplement I consistently recommend. 200-400mg, 30-60 minutes before bed. Most people are deficient. Look for glycinate or bisglycinate form — not oxide.

**💡 Light: Light Therapy Lamp (10,000 lux)**
Essential for winter months and people with delayed chronotypes. 20-30 minutes at breakfast. $30-50 for a good one.

**😴 Comfort: Weighted Blanket (optional)**
Works for some people, especially those with anxiety. Try before you commit — they're not for everyone. 10% of your body weight is the rule.

I keep an updated product guide with specific brand recommendations and links in the Masterclass and Insider membership. But these categories are the essentials.

**Subject:** {{first_name}}, where are you now?
**Preview:** Honest check-in
**Delay after previous:** 1 day

{{first_name}},

It's been almost a month since you downloaded your Sleep Blueprint.

I'm curious — where are you with your sleep?

- Better than before?
- About the same?
- Worse? (It happens — stress, life changes, etc.)

Hit reply and tell me. One sentence is fine. I read every response.

If things have improved, I'd love to know what helped most. Was it the temperature change? The caffeine cutoff? The consistent wake time? Something else?

If things haven't improved, tell me that too. Sometimes the fix is something specific that generic tips don't address. I might be able to point you in the right direction.

Either way, this is the second-to-last email in this sequence. Tomorrow I'll wrap up with a summary of everything we've covered and where to go from here.

Thanks for sticking with me this month, {{first_name}}. It means a lot.
