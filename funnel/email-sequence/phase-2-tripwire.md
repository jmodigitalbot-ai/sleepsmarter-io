Can I tell you something personal?

For most of my twenties, I was a mess.

I'd drag myself out of bed every morning, slam two cups of coffee before 9 AM, crash around 2 PM, drink more coffee, lie awake until midnight, and repeat. I thought I was just "not a morning person." That it was genetic. Permanent.

I was a sleep researcher who couldn't sleep. The irony wasn't lost on me.

Then I hit a wall. I made a mistake at work — a big one — because I was running on 4 hours of fragmented sleep. That was my wake-up call (no pun intended).

I spent the next three months testing every sleep technique I could find. Most were garbage. Some helped a little. But when I combined the ones that worked into a specific 7-day sequence... everything changed.

By day 3, I was falling asleep in under 15 minutes.
By day 5, I was waking up before my alarm.
By day 7, I felt like a different person.

I started sharing it with colleagues. Then patients. Then friends of friends. The results were consistent — not perfect for everyone, but consistently better.

I eventually formalized it into what I now call the **7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol.**

You got a preview of it in your Sleep Blueprint. But the preview is just the roadmap. The full protocol is the GPS — turn-by-turn directions, what to do when you get lost, and troubleshooting for every common problem.

I'll tell you more about it tomorrow. But first — did you try any of the tips from the Blueprint? I'd genuinely love to hear.

Hit reply and let me know.

## EMAIL 7 (Day 7)

**Subject:** Day 1 of the protocol (try this tonight)
**Preview:** The most important 60 seconds of your day

{{first_name}},

I'm going to give you Day 1 of the Sleep Reset Protocol for free. Right here. Right now.

**Day 1: Anchor Your Wake Time**

Here's what you do:

1. Pick your wake time. Not your ideal wake time. Your REAL wake time — the time you actually need to be up for your life to work.

2. Set ONE alarm. Not three. Not five with 9-minute snooze intervals. One.

3. When it goes off, do this within 60 seconds:
   - Feet on the floor
   - Lights on (or curtains open)
   - 10 seconds of deep breathing

That's it. That's Day 1.

"Sarah, that seems too simple."

It is simple. It's also the foundation that everything else builds on. Here's why:

Your circadian rhythm — your internal 24-hour clock — is anchored by ONE signal more than any other: **when you wake up.** Not when you go to bed. When you WAKE UP.

Every time you hit snooze, sleep in on weekends, or vary your wake time by more than 30 minutes, you're telling your brain "I don't know when morning is." And a confused brain can't prepare for sleep at the right time.

Consistent wake time → consistent sleepiness at bedtime → faster sleep onset → complete sleep cycles → refreshed mornings.

**It starts with Day 1. Try it tomorrow morning.**

Now, Days 2-7 build on this foundation with specific protocols for light exposure, caffeine timing, environment optimization, wind-down routines, and weekend consistency. Each day has:

- Exact instructions (what to do and when)
- The science behind it (so you understand WHY)
- Troubleshooting tips (for when it doesn't go perfectly)
- A tracking checklist (so you can measure progress)

The complete protocol is $17 and it's changed the sleep of thousands of people.

Or don't. Day 1 alone will help. But if you want the full system — the one that compounds day over day — it's there when you're ready.

## EMAIL 8 (Day 8)

**Subject:** "I can't believe the difference" — Maria K.
**Preview:** She was skeptical too

{{first_name}},

I got this email last month and it made my day:

> *"Sarah, I've been a terrible sleeper for 15 years. I've tried melatonin, meditation apps, weighted blankets, CBD — you name it. Nothing stuck for more than a week.*
>
> *I almost didn't buy the protocol because $17 seemed too cheap to actually work. (I've spent hundreds on supplements that did nothing.)*
>
> *But by Day 4, I was falling asleep in 10 minutes. TEN MINUTES. I used to lie awake for an hour minimum. By Day 7, my husband noticed the difference before I told him about it. He said I seemed 'lighter.'*
>
> *I can't believe the difference. I wish I'd found this years ago."*
>
> — Maria K., Phoenix, AZ

Maria's story isn't unusual. But I want to be transparent about something:

**The protocol doesn't work for everyone.**

It works best for people who:
✅ Have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
✅ Wake up feeling tired despite "enough" hours
✅ Have inconsistent sleep schedules
✅ Are willing to follow 7 days of instructions

It's NOT a substitute for medical treatment if you have:
❌ Diagnosed sleep apnea
❌ Chronic insomnia requiring medication
❌ A medical condition affecting sleep

For the vast majority of people who "just don't sleep well," it works. And it works fast.

60-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't help, email me and I'll refund you immediately. No questions.

## EMAIL 10 (Day 10)

**Subject:** Last call + a bonus I haven't mentioned
**Preview:** Closing this out today

{{first_name}},

Last email about the Sleep Reset Protocol. I promise.

Before I move on, I want to add one thing I haven't mentioned:

**BONUS: The "Can't Sleep" Audio Guide**

I recorded a 12-minute guided relaxation specifically designed for when you're lying in bed and can't fall asleep. It uses a technique called cognitive shuffling — basically, it gives your brain random, boring images to process, which prevents the anxious thought loops that keep you awake.

I've had people tell me this single audio is worth more than the rest of the protocol combined.

It's included free with the 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol.

**[Get Instant Access → $17](link)**

Here's what you're getting for $17:
- ✅ Complete 7-day protocol with daily instructions
- ✅ Sleep tracking templates
- ✅ Supplement timing guide
- ✅ Environment optimization checklist
- ✅ Emergency Sleep Protocol
- ✅ **NEW: "Can't Sleep" Audio Guide**
- ✅ 60-day money-back guarantee

After today, I'll go back to sending you free sleep tips and articles. No more pitches for a while. But if you've been on the fence, this is the moment.

**[Yes, I want better sleep → $17](link)**

Either way, I'll talk to you tomorrow with something completely different — a myth about caffeine that will probably surprise you.

Sarah
