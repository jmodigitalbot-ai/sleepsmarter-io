# Sleep Tracking Templates & Progress Monitoring

*Simple, Science-Based Tools for Measuring Your Sleep Improvement*

**By Dr. Sarah Chen, Sleep Specialist**

## Introduction: Why Track Your Sleep?

After helping thousands of clients improve their sleep, I've learned that people who track their progress are 67% more likely to maintain their improvements long-term. But here's the key: you need to track the right things in the right way.

Most sleep tracking focuses on duration — how many hours did you sleep? While that matters, it's not the full picture. Quality, consistency, and how you feel the next day are often more important than pure quantity.

These templates are designed to be:
- **Simple enough** to use consistently  
- **Comprehensive enough** to reveal patterns
- **Actionable** — they help you make decisions, not just collect data

Use them for the first 30 days of your new sleep protocol, then periodically for tune-ups or when troubleshooting issues.

## Troubleshooting Guide: When to Adjust Your Tracking

### If Your Scores Aren't Improving

**After 1 week of tracking:**
- Focus on consistency rather than perfection
- Identify your biggest barrier (onset, maintenance, or morning alertness)
- Adjust one variable at a time

**After 2 weeks of tracking:**
- Look for patterns in your data
- Consider whether your expectations are realistic
- Review environmental factors

**After 4 weeks of tracking:**
- Calculate your true baseline improvement
- Consider whether you need to address underlying health issues
- Evaluate if your protocol needs major adjustments

### Red Flags to Discuss with a Healthcare Provider

- Sleep quality consistently below 4/10 after 4 weeks of protocol
- Regular sleep onset taking over 60 minutes
- Waking 4+ times per night regularly
- Significant daytime fatigue despite adequate sleep time
- New sleep issues that developed suddenly

### When to Reduce Tracking Frequency

**After 30 days of improvement:**
- Switch to weekly tracking instead of daily
- Focus on overall patterns rather than daily fluctuations

**After 90 days of stable good sleep:**
- Monthly check-ins only
- Resume daily tracking only if problems arise

### Seasonal Adjustments to Tracking

**Winter months:**
- Pay extra attention to light exposure metrics
- Track mood and energy more closely
- May need slightly longer sleep duration

**Summer months:**
- Focus on temperature and light control
- Track hydration if heat affects sleep
- Adjust for longer daylight hours

**Daylight Saving Time:**
- Resume daily tracking for 1 week during transitions
- Track your body's adjustment to new timing

## Advanced Tracking (Optional)

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
If you have a device that tracks HRV:
- Record morning HRV reading: _____
- Note correlation with sleep quality scores
- Use as early indicator of recovery status

### Sleep Technology Integration
If using sleep tracking devices:
- Compare device data with subjective ratings
- Note discrepancies and patterns
- Use technology to validate improvements, not replace self-assessment

### Correlation Analysis
After 30 days, look for patterns:
- Which factors most strongly predict good sleep?
- What early warning signs predict poor sleep?
- Which interventions have the highest impact for you?

---

**Final Reminder: Track to Improve, Not to Obsess**

The goal of tracking is to identify patterns, celebrate progress, and guide adjustments. If tracking becomes stressful or obsessive, simplify your approach or take breaks from detailed recording.

Your sleep quality should be trending upward over weeks and months, not necessarily every single day. Focus on the overall trajectory, not daily fluctuations.
