## Product Name
**The 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol: Transform Your Sleep in One Week**

## Product Description (Main Copy)

**Stop Trying to Fix Your Sleep Piece by Piece. Here's the Complete System That Actually Works.**

If you're tired of reading sleep tips that work for a few days then stop... if you're frustrated with generic advice that doesn't account for your busy schedule... if you're ready to finally get consistent, restorative sleep without spending hours researching...

**This is the exact step-by-step protocol I use with my $300/hour private clients.**

I'm Dr. Sarah Chen, and I've helped over 2,000 people transform their sleep. But I wasn't always good at this. Five years ago, I was a sleep specialist who couldn't sleep well myself.

The problem wasn't that I didn't know the science. The problem was that I was trying to implement everything at once, in the wrong order.

That's why I created the **7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol** — a day-by-day implementation guide that fixes the root causes of poor sleep in the exact sequence that creates lasting change.

## Why This Works When Other Methods Fail

Most sleep advice gives you pieces of the puzzle but doesn't show you how they fit together. You might try:
- Blackout curtains (but still wake up at 3 AM)
- Meditation apps (but still can't quiet your mind)
- Sleep supplements (but they stop working after a week)
- Strict bedtimes (but you just lie there frustrated)

**The 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol works because:**

1. **It's Sequential:** Each day builds on the previous one, creating compound improvements
2. **It's Personalized:** You learn how to adapt each technique to your unique situation
3. **It's Actionable:** Clear "do this, then this" instructions, not vague suggestions
4. **It's Evidence-Based:** Every recommendation is backed by sleep science research
5. **It's Realistic:** Designed for busy people with actual lives, not perfect laboratory conditions

## What Real Users Are Saying

*"I've struggled with sleep for 15 years. I've tried everything — melatonin, meditation, white noise machines. Nothing worked consistently until I followed Sarah's 7-day protocol. By Day 3, I was falling asleep naturally. By Day 7, I was sleeping through the night for the first time in years."* — Jessica M., 42

*"As a shift worker, I thought good sleep was impossible for me. The 7-Day Reset Protocol showed me how to work with my schedule instead of against it. I'm getting better sleep now than I did when I worked 9-5."* — Michael T., 38

*"I was skeptical because $17 seemed too cheap to be valuable. But this is the most comprehensive sleep guide I've ever seen. The supplement timing guide alone is worth the price."* — David L., 51

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is this different from the free Sleep Blueprint I already downloaded?**
A: The Sleep Blueprint gives you general principles and concepts. The 7-Day Sleep Reset Protocol gives you the exact day-by-day implementation plan, troubleshooting guides, personalization instructions, and bonus materials that turn those principles into actual results.

**Q: What if I can't implement everything perfectly?**
A: That's expected! This protocol is designed for real people with real lives. Each day includes "minimum viable implementation" options for when you're busy, plus troubleshooting for when things don't go as planned.

**Q: How much time does this require each day?**
A: Most days require 10-30 minutes of active implementation, plus some passive changes to your environment and habits. The protocol is designed to fit into existing routines, not replace them.

**Q: What if I have a medical sleep disorder?**
A: This protocol is designed for common sleep issues, not medical conditions like sleep apnea or narcolepsy. If you suspect you have a medical sleep disorder, please consult a healthcare professional. This protocol can still help optimize your sleep alongside medical treatment.

**Q: Is this just another "sleep hygiene" list?**
A: No. Sleep hygiene lists give you disconnected tips. This protocol gives you a strategic sequence where each intervention builds on the previous one, creating a system that's greater than the sum of its parts.

**Q: What format will I receive the materials in?**
A: You'll get immediate access to downloadable PDF files that you can read on any device or print if you prefer. The files are mobile-friendly and organized for easy navigation.
