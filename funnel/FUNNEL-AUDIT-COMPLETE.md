### Current Gap: NO POST-PURCHASE FLOW EXISTS

### Proposed Upsell/Downsell Sequence:

   - **Offer:** "Sleep Environment Optimization Guide" + "Supplement Protocol Cheat Sheet"
   - **Price:** $9 (one-time)
   - **Value:** Immediate actionable content
   - **Position:** Below order confirmation, before download links

2. **Downsell if Declined:**

   - **Price:** FREE (email capture for future nurturing)
   - **CTA:** "Get Your Free Sleep Tracker"

#### **Post-Purchase Email Sequence (Triggered by Purchase)**
**Day 0 (Immediate):** 
- Welcome email with download links
- **Upsell:** "Complete Your Sleep Transformation" → Masterclass ($67) with $17 credit applied
- **Mechanism:** "You've already invested $17, apply it toward the $67 Masterclass"

**Day 1 (24 hours later):**
- "How to get the most from Day 1" email
- **Upsell:** "90-Day Transformation" ($197) with bundle discount
- **Value Prop:** "Get personalized coaching + all protocols"

**Day 3 (72 hours later):**
- Check-in email: "How's Day 3 going?"
- **Downsell:** "Sleep Smarter Insider" membership ($19/mo) trial
- **Offer:** 7-day free trial, then $19/mo

**Day 7 (Week later):**
- "Congratulations on completing Week 1!"
- **Final Upsell:** All offers presented as options
- **Exit Survey:** "Which would help you most?" (segments for future targeting)
